**AI as a service(s business)**

I've written about machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) before \[1\], [summarising Vicki Boykis' work on how you often don't need fancy tech, and usually the business dictates, not the tech.](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/you-dont-want-quality-time-you-want "ABP") Scott Locklin elaborates on the problems machine learning startups face [here](https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2020/02/21/andreessen-horowitz-craps-on-ai-startups-from-a-great-height/ "Scott") \[2\], mostly responding to a related a16z post [here.](https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software/ "a16z") His main points are:

1. ML costs a lot for marginal payoffs

2. ML startups generally have no moat or meaningful special sauce

3. ML startups are mostly services businesses, not software businesses

These are more negative views than general consensus, so let's see why he thinks this is the case. I'll be quoting from both Scott and the a16z post by Martin Casado and Matt Bornstein.

**Cost**

> Taken together, these \[cloud operation and compute\] forces contribute to the 25% or more of revenue that AI companies often spend on cloud resources. In extreme cases, startups tackling particularly complex tasks have actually found manual data processing cheaper than executing a trained \[ML\] model. - a16z

> The pricing structure of “cloud” bullshit is designed to extract maximum blood from people with heavy data or compute requirements. - Scott

Is 25% of rev spent on just cloud operations \[3\] a lot? To contextualise that number, let's look at the total cost of goods (COGS) of Salesforce, a best-in-class software company. [Their 8K](https://s23.q4cdn.com/574569502/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/CRM-Q4-FY20-Earnings-Press-Release-w-financials.pdf "8K") shows a total COGS of 25%, which includes all other costs that Salesforce would classify in that category \[4\], not just cloud costs. In order to have the same margin as a Salesforce, AI companies would need to have no other COGS besides cloud costs.

> anecdotal data shows that many companies spend up to 10-15% of revenue on \[manual data cleaning and data accuracy maintenance\] process – usually not counting core engineering resources – and suggests ongoing development work exceeds typical bug fixes and feature additions - a16z

Turns out AI companies do have other COGS, spending up to 15% on manual data processes. Mainstream media is focused on the predictions from machine learning, [but data scientists spend more of their time on data collection and cleaning.](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/you-dont-want-quality-time-you-want "ABP") That isn't going away, meaning **most AI companies are immediately 15% less profitable than a software company.**

The allure of investing in software companies is that marginal costs are low, so a high percentage of incremental revenue is converted to profit. AI companies need to lower that COGS % or expect some benefit of scale in order to be as attractive. Is that likely?  

> the computational power of GPU chips hasn’t exactly been growing apace - Scott

AI requires [graphics processing units (GPUs) to do the computing.](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/ "GPU") However, the resources required have grown enormously compared to the growth in computing power; Moore's Law isn't applying on the AI compute side. We shouldn't expect that 25% COGS above to go down significantly any time soon.

> Since the range of possible input values is so large, each new customer deployment is likely to generate data that has never been seen before - a16z

> most people haven’t figured out that ML oriented processes almost never scale like a simpler application would - Scott

Not only should we not expect the 25% compute cost to go down, but we shouldn't expect the other 15% to go down either. [That low margin still takes a lot of work to get.](https://avc.com/2020/04/not-all-gross-margin-is-the-same/ "AVC") **Not only are AI companies less profitable, but we should expect that margin profile to last for a while**

**Moat**

Is that increase in cost worth it? Neither a16z nor Scott seem to think so:

> In the AI world, technical differentiation is harder to achieve. \[...\] Data is the core of an AI system, but it’s often owned by customers, in the public domain, or over time becomes a commodity. - a16z

> I know that, from a business perspective, something dumb like Naive Bayes or a linear model might solve the customer’s problem just as well as the latest gigawatt neural net atrocity. \[...\] People won’t pay a premium over in-house ad-hoc data science solutions unless it represents truly game changing results. - Scott

If a company's product isn't actually significantly better, they have to result to sales and marketing in order to differentiate. **This implies even higher costs compared to a typical software company, which is already sales heavy.** It does make you wonder whether the hype around machine learning is justified or is used to justify a company's survival. 

> Many companies are finding that the minimum viable task for AI models is narrower than they expected. - a16z

> but the hockey stick required for VC backing, and the army of Ph.D.s required to make it work doesn’t really mix well with those limited domains, which have a limited market. - Scott

It's commonly thought that you can just throw machine learning at any problem and it'll magically work for that problem and any other similar problems. Unfortunately, for now whatever solution you're using will only work in that very limited use case. This implies further difficulties in scaling AI compared to traditional software.

If AI has limited use cases, that also means that the total addressable market to sell your AI product into is a lot smaller than what you thought it was. Given VCs consider [size of market as a key factor for investment,](https://bettereveryday.vc/how-to-prove-your-market-is-big-enough-to-vcs-d04059d93380 "size") this seems like it'll be a problem too. 

**Services businesses vs software businesses**

> To summarize: most AI systems today aren’t quite software, in the traditional sense. And AI businesses, as a result, don’t look exactly like software businesses. They involve ongoing human support and material variable costs. They often don’t scale quite as easily as we’d like. And strong defensibility – critical to the “build once / sell many times” software model – doesn’t seem to come for free. - a16z

> services companies are not valued like software businesses are. VCs love software businesses; work hard up front to solve a problem, print money forever. That’s why they get the 10-20x revenues valuations. Services companies? Why would you invest in a services company? Their growth is inherently constrained by labor costs and weird addressable market issues. - Scott

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/AI rev multiple.jpg)

Businesses are often valued based on a multiple of some financial metric such as reveue, EBITDA, net profit. Software companies are usually valued at a higher multiple than services companies, due to the scalability at lower variable costs that we've mentioned above. [Higher gross margins matter, as described by Two Sigma](https://twosigmaventures.com/blog/article/why-gross-margins-matter/ "Two") 

Both a16z and Scott are implying that **an AI company is more similar to a services company and hence should get a lower valuation multiple than a software company.** Even if you think they'll get a higher multiple than the 2x revenue that services get, AI companies shouldn't be getting the 10x revenue that traditional software companies do, and that these AI companies previously raised money at.

This will likely be a problem for AI companies that have raised at high valuations and are now finding it hard to raise their next round due to more people realising the above issues. I'd expect, with 60% certainty, that we'll start to see low valuations for late stage AI company private rounds. 

**The practice of value investing by Li Lu**

Warren Buffett's partner, Charlie Munger, has given money to an outsider to run [only once in his life.](https://qz.com/work/1551328/the-only-person-besides-warren-buffett-who-charlie-munger-trusts-with-his-money/ "Munger") That outsider is [Li Lu of Himalaya Capital.](http://himalayacapital.com/ "Himalaya") 

Founded in 1998, Himalaya is a value investing firm, focused on companies in Asia with an emphasis on China. Typical of that investment style, they look to be long-term owners of quality companies that compound over time \[21\]. [They've historically taken a 0% management fee, and 25% carry after a 6% return hurdle.](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/valueinvesting/sites/valueinvesting/files/files/Graham%20%26%20Doddsville%20-%20Issue%2018%20-%20Spring%202013_0.pdf "Graham") This is unusual in the investment industry, and demonstrates how confident they are in generating annual returns \[22\].

Since Li Lu is China focused, there are fewer interviews of him than other famous investors. Graham of Longriver recently [translated a 9,000 word speech outlining Li Lu's investment philosophy,](https://www.longriverinv.com/blog/the-practice-of-value-investing-by-li-lu "Longriver") which I'll summarise below \[23\]. There are multiple ways to make money, and value investing is one style we can learn from.

Li Lu discussed four basic concepts of value investing, the difference between investing and speculating, circles of competence, investor temperament, and what the average person can do to grow wealth. I found that most of these can be bucketed under his four concepts, which are:

1. Stocks represent part ownership of a business

2. The market is a guide, and it's up to you to accept or reject it

3. Investing is about probability and a margin of safety

4. Build a circle of competence and stick within it

**Stocks represent part ownership**

The concept of buying a stock as buying ownership in the company is common among followers of Buffett's value investing style. Rather than viewing a stock price as a number, Li Lu views it as responsibility to know and care about the company he's bought. This is in contrast to long/short hedge funds who trade more on sentiment and price catalysts, or quant funds that trade on who knows what \[24\].

> no longer were people trying to guess the future results of the East India Company; they were simply trying to guess the behaviour of other people buying and selling the stock.  

Li Lu discusses the history of the stock market, which was first created to let companies raise capital to fund their growth. It then took advantage of humanity's gambling nature, to become not just a bet on the future of the company, but a bet on what you think other people think of the future of the company. 

> 



He makes two points here. Firstly, that the ability to exchange ownership rights freely gives an indication of how society views the protection of private property rights \[24\]. Secondly, that investment should be viewed as ownership, distinct from speculation. This point of view is typically held by value investors, and he'll elaborate at length later. 

> 2. The market is a guide.

He discusses [the popular anecdote of Mr Market,](https://fs.blog/2013/11/mr-market/ "Market") which highlights how the stock market can be viewed as something that shouts a price at you daily. It's up to you to make a decision on when to buy and sell, and you're better off ignoring the market price most of the time.

This is much harder to do in practice. It's one thing to say you're a disciplined person that just puts their money in index funds. It's another to resist buying options in your robinhood account when you hear your friends made $10k in one day by lurking on r/wallstreetbets. 

> 3. The most important thing in investing is predicting the future but the future is inherently unpredictable. Investing is therefore about probability and a margin of safety.

Investing being about probability is a concept most professionals would agree with, regardless of style. Even the best investors have a hit rate in the 50-60% range, meaning they are wrong a lot. Rather than going in 100% on a single name, they think in terms of investing in a portfolio of names, sizing each position accordingly based on what they think the odds of success for each company is. 

The margin of safety one is more controversial, and more typical of value investors. This is the idea that for every investment you make, you should do so at a price that still gives you enough buffer should there be unexpected declines.

> 4. Build a circle of competence and stick within it.

Popularised by Buffett, this is the idea that you should deeply understand an industry or issue, and stick within that. Since investing outperformance is about a [relative, not absolute edge,](https://research-doc.credit-suisse.com/docView?language=ENG&format=PDF&source_id=em&document_id=805456950&serialid=LsvBuE4wt3XNGE0V%2B3ec251NK9soTQqcMVQ9q2QuF2I%3D "Mauboussin") overextending yourself into an area you don't know as well as others is likely to be dangerous. He discuses this in detail later as well.

**Investing vs speculation**



This is similar to the [Keynesian beauty contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest "contest") concept. It's also where value investors will differ from many other professionals. 

> This is the biggest difference between investing and speculating: in the end, the net result of all speculation is zero. Of course, there will be some people who win for a bit longer; and some \[who are taken for suckers\] without any chance to strike it rich. But with enough time, all speculation ends in a zero-sum result. Therefore, due to their focus on short term behaviour, speculators have absolutely no influence on economic growth or a company’s profits.

I'm less definite than Li Lu on this, and do believe speculators can influence company behaviour, whether it be through activist investing or more regular investor conference meetings. This doesn't take away from his general point though, that speculating is zero-sum. When you outperform on a company due to issues unrelated to company growth, someone else on the other side of that trade has underperformed.

**Circle of competence**

Li Lu tells a long story about how he got started in investing, which was due to a lunch he attended where Buffett was speaking \[25\]. He started reading more of Buffett's writing, researching companies, and visiting them on site when he could, even when all he could do was talk to security. In doing so, he discovered four lessons in developing a circle of competence:

> The first lesson was that stocks represent partial ownership in a business

> The second point is that when you start looking at things from an owners’ point of view, your understanding of business will be completely different

> When analysts join our company, the first thing we do is to send them to study some companies. We ask them to assume an uncle they’ve never met before has passed away and left them the business. What should they do? They suddenly inherit this asset but have no idea what it is. You must call a board meeting and participate in the discussion. This is the mental model we ask them to use when they conduct their research.  

He separates these two points, but I feel they're similar enough to be discussed together. Regardless of what your stake is in the company, Li Lu is saying that you should view yourself as a full owner. That mindset will motivate you to continue wanting to know as much about the company as possible, and understand what decisions are good vs bad for the company's future.

> The third point is that knowledge is indeed cumulative but you must always maintain intellectual honesty

I've discussed [being open-minded and intellectually honest before,](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/improving-forecasts-and-incentivising "intellectual") and would again agree that this is important but hard to do. When's the last time you've changed your mind on a non-trivial issue? 

> The last thing is that you should let your passion be your guide. Don’t listen to what others think of you. They have nothing to do with you. Accept that your circle of competence will be small and don’t worry about everything else. Making money doesn’t depend on how much you know; it depends on whether what you know is right or wrong. If what you know is right, you will not lose money.

Again, this is a contrast to how many other investment funds work in practice, where they usually want investment analysts to increase their coverage of names and industry sectors over time. It's hard to tell the limited partners of your fund (the ones that give you their capital for you to invest) that you're in the same investments you were in the previous quarter; keep that up long enough and they'll wonder why they're paying you to do nothing. Hence, for many funds there's an incentive to actively trade in and out of names, and the larger the set of names you know the better.

**Concluding thoughts**

> this profession doesn’t demand you to be especially smart, nor to have a high IQ or the best academic credentials

Li Lu describes attributes that make a successful investor, which are:

1. The person must be independent, and not care about other's evaluations

2. The person must be objective, and willing to learn always

3. The person must have both extreme patience and extreme decisiveness when great opportunities come along

4. The person must be interested in how businesses work

Keeping in mind the core concepts of value investing above, these investor traits make sense. For a typical long/short fund, they'd be less concerned about (3). A typical quant fund would likely be less concerned about (4). 

> The biggest taboo for investors is to be like Newton and be seduced by the market: to buy at the market’s hottest peak and to sell at its most depressed. If you don’t participate in speculation and stick strictly to investing in what you understand, then you won’t lose money. 

> With compound interest and the right approach, your wealth will grow gradually and in time become quite sizeable.

> The best and most important thing is to have a long enough time over which to compound.  Our suggestion to the average person is to only do things you understand and to stay away from everything else.

Given his background as a long term value investor, it's not a surprise that he advocates for growing wealth slowly via compounding over a long term. 

Value investing is one way of making money, and there are many other ways that have been successful for various lengths of time. [Renaisssance seems to print money,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Technologies "Ren") for example, and they do nothing remotely related to the value investing discussed above. If you do decide to stick with value investing, Li Lu's lessons above will be helpful, with the key takeaway being to think like an owner.

22. Most investment firms take a management fee on assets invested with them, and then a performance fee on returns from the assets. A typical fee structure is "2 and 20", meaning a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee. If you put in $1000 and it grew to $1200, assuming the management fee is taken off ending period values, the management fee would be $24 (2% * $1200) and the performance fee $40 (20% * ($1200 - $1000)). Compare this to Li Lu's fee model which only takes performance fees after the first 6% of returns. Here there would be no management fee, and the performance fee would be $47 (25% * ($1200 - $1000 - (6% * $200))). It's an open secret that many investment firms live off the fixed management fees from growing their assets under managment rather than performance. Li Lu's model would be more beneficial for him if he believed he could generate high returns, and less beneficial if he does poorly.
