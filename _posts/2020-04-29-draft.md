**The practice of value investing by Li Lu**

Warren Buffett's partner, Charlie Munger, has given money to an outsider to run [only once in his life.](https://qz.com/work/1551328/the-only-person-besides-warren-buffett-who-charlie-munger-trusts-with-his-money/ "Munger") That outsider is [Li Lu of Himalaya Capital.](http://himalayacapital.com/ "Himalaya") 

Founded in 1998, Himalaya is a value investing firm, focused on companies in Asia with an emphasis on China. Typical of that investment style, they look to be long-term owners of quality companies that compound over time \[1\]. T[hey've historically taken a 0% management fee, and 25% carry after a 6% return hurdle.](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/valueinvesting/sites/valueinvesting/files/files/Graham%20%26%20Doddsville%20-%20Issue%2018%20-%20Spring%202013_0.pdf "Graham") This is unusual in the investment industry, and demonstrates how confident they are in generating annual returns \[2\].

Since Li Lu is China focused, there are fewer interviews of him than popular investors. Graham of Longriver recently [translated a speech that highlights Li Lu's investment philosophy,](https://www.longriverinv.com/blog/the-practice-of-value-investing-by-li-lu "Longriver") and I'll be highlighting portions below \[3\].

**Basic concepts**

He starts with his four core concepts of value investing:

> 1. Stocks confer part-ownership of a business.

He makes two points here. Firstly, that the ability to exchange ownership rights freely gives an indication of how society views the protection of private property rights \[4\]. Secondly, that investment should be viewed as ownership, distinct from speculation. This point of view is typically held by value investors. 

> 2. The market is a guide.

He discusses [the popular anecdote of Mr Market,](https://fs.blog/2013/11/mr-market/ "Market") which highlights how the stock market can be viewed as something that shouts a price at you daily. It's up to you to make a decision on when to buy and sell, and you're better off ignoring the market price most of the time.

This is much harder to do in practice. It's one thing to say you're a disciplined person that just puts their money in index funds. It's another to resist 

> 3. The most important thing in investing is predicting the future but the future is inherently unpredictable.  Investing is therefore about probability and a margin of safety.

> 4. Build a circle of competence and stick within it.

**Footnotes**

1. "We embrace the value investment principles of Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, and Charles Munger, and today primarily focus on publicly traded companies in Asia, with an emphasis on China.  We aim to achieve superior returns by being long-term owners of high quality companies with substantial “economic moat”, great growth potential, and run by trust-worthy people.  Some of our holdings date back to our inception twenty years ago."
2. Most investment firms take a management fee on assets invested with them, and then a performance fee on returns from the assets. A typical fee structure is "2 and 20", meaning a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee. If you put in $1000 and it grew to $1200, assuming the management fee is taken off ending period values, the management fee would be $24 (2% * $1200) and the performance fee $40 (20% * ($1200 - $1000)). Compare this to Li Lu's fee model which only takes performance fees after the first 6% of returns. Here there would be no management fee, and the performance fee would be $47 (25% * ($1200 - $1000 - (6% * $200))). It's an open secret that many investment firms live off the fixed management fees from growing their assets under managment rather than performance. Li Lu's model would be more beneficial for him if he believed he could generate high returns, and less beneficial if he does poorly.
3. I believe it's the same speech [previously translated on gurufocus,](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/997607/notes-from-li-lus-latest-speech-at-peking-university "guru") and Graham's version seems more comprehensive. I've (very) briefly checked the translation and it seems accurate, but I can't fully guarantee the piece obviously. The original is [here](https://xueqiu.com/6026781624/137223946 "original")
4. Somewhat strange considering he mainly invests in China.
