### Takeaway

<style>
      .iframe-container {
        overflow: hidden;        
        padding-top: 50%; <!-- Calculated from the aspect ration of the content (in case of 16:9 it is 9/16= 0.5625) -->
        position: relative;
      }
      .iframe-container iframe { 
         border: 0;
         height: 100%; <!-- Finally, width and height are set to 100% so the iframe takes up 100% of the containers space. -->
         left: 0;
         position: absolute;
         top: 0;
         width: 100%;
         display: block;
         margin: 0 auto; <!-- center image -->
      }
      <!-- 4x3 Aspect Ratio -->
      .iframe-container-4x3 {
        padding-top: 75%;
      }

### Main

"Do people tend to make better decisions when the stakes are high?"

Research into this topic will help us know:

1. Whether our decision making is the same under small vs high stakes
2. If different, whether that difference is due to low effort or something else

They chose to test using 4 types of commonly researched biases below \[1\]. I have a section explaining the bias and how it's commonly tested for later.

1. Base rate neglect (underweighting prior probability)
2. Anchoring (overly relying on early info)
3. Failure of contingent thinking (deductive reasoning)
4. Intuitive reasoning

#### Biases

### Footnotes

1. Reasoning for these 4 was "(i) the tasks that underlie these biases have an objectively correct answer; (ii) the biases are cognitive in nature, rather than preference-based; (iii) standard experimental instructions to measure these biases are short and simple, which helps rule out confusion resulting from complex instructions; and (iv) these biases all have received much attention and ample experimental scrutiny in the literature
