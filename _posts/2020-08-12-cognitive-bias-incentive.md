### Main

Imagine you had to solve a math problem. Do you think your performance would be better if you got a $10 reward for solving it? What about a $1,000 reward? 

We like to think that getting more money better incentives us, leading us to put in more effort and get better results. For example, one theory of high executive pay is that they're being paid for their better decision making \[1\]. Does getting a higher monetary reward actually help them make better decisions?

If it involves avoiding cognitive biases, probably not. Researchers found that people have the same incorrect biases, whether offered a low reward or a high one. This might mean that monetary rewards do not have as large an influence on decision quality as we think. 

In their paper ["Cognitive Biases: Mistakes or Missing Stakes?",](https://www.ifo.de/DocDL/cesifo1_wp8168.pdf "pdf") the researchers \[1\] look into how performance on tests is affected by the stakes. The question they wanted to answer was: Do people tend to make better decisions when the stakes are high?

What they ended up finding was that **people make the same types of cognitive bias errors whether they were offered low or high rewards.** 

Although their amount of effort increased, the actual scores were similar in both cases. This implies that it's not lack of effort, but the "right way of looking at a problem," causing people to fail at cognitive bias questions.

Applied to decision making, this could mean that having higher stakes doesn't improve performance. You could pay your executives well, but don't expect that to induce better decision making.

Below, I'll go into the details of the experiment.

#### Experiment details

They chose to test using 4 types of commonly researched biases below \[1\]. I have a section explaining each bias and how it was tested for later.

1. Base rate neglect (underweighting prior probability)
2. Anchoring (overly relying on early info)
3. Failure of contingent thinking (deductive reasoning)
4. Intuitive reasoning

The experiment wanted to see behaviour under high monetary stakes. To run the experiment cost effectively, they conducted it in the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics in Nairobi, Kenya. This way, they could offer participants a large amount in local purchasing power, while still keeping costs down e.g. offer a month's salary as a reward \[2\]

Researchers first gave the N = 1,236 participants the test without any bonus reward. Then, the researchers told the participants there would be bonus rewards available for doing better on the next test. 

They measured performance and response times as dependent variables against the incentive structure. Performance is measured by percentage of responses on the test correct for that bias category, and response time was the average response time to questions of that bias category. e.g. you could get 80% correct and an average 20s response time to base rate neglect types of questions.

#### Biases

#### Results

What they found was that for many tests, the higher incentive amount doesn't reduce cognitive biases. In the image below, each graph is one type of cognitive bias test. Within each graph is the three incentive types given - no, standard, and high. The performance on each is shown. In many of the experiments, there's no increase in performance, moving from the "standard incentive" tick mark to the "high incentive" tick mark.

And when looking at response times, a proxy for effort, they found that people did put in more effort when the incentive amount increased. In the graphs below, you can see the "high incentive" sections all being higher than the "standard incentive" sections, implying people took longer to think when they were given more money.

#### Follow up questions

1. Can we relate performance on cognitive bias tests to general decision making? Does getting better at the former imply getting better at the latter?
2. How do you measure performance for general decision making? What is the best decision?

1. Reasoning for these 4 was "(i) the tasks that underlie these biases have an objectively correct answer; (ii) the biases are cognitive in nature, rather than preference-based; (iii) standard experimental instructions to measure these biases are short and simple, which helps rule out confusion resulting from complex instructions; and (iv) these biases all have received much attention and ample experimental scrutiny in the literature
