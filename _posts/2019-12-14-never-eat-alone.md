I first read Keith Ferrazzi's "Never Eat Alone" more than ten years ago and took some useful advice from it. I re-read it recently to see how well it holds up, and took the following notes:

> There's no point in keeping track of favors done and owed. Who cares? 

> Contribute. Give your time, money, and expertise to your growing community of friends

> The \[Relationship Action\] Plan is separated into three distinct parts: The first part is devoted to the development of the goals that will help you fulifill your mission. The second part is devoted to connecting those goals to the people, places, and things that will help you get the job done. And the third part helps you determine the best way to reach out to the people who will help you to accomplish your goals

> Create a personal board of advisors

> Doing good work for your employer comes first. Finding time to manage your outside work is your responsibility

> Constantly create the environment and community you want for yourself

> Don't schmooze, don't rely on the currency of gossip, don't come to the party empty-handed, don't treat those under you poorly, be transparent, don't be too efficient

> Follow-up is the key to success in any field

> The only way to get people to do anything is to recognize their importance and thereby make them feel important

> There are three things in this world that engender deep emotional bonds between people. They are health, wealth, and children

> But if thirty years ago power was attained through a monopoly of information, \[...\] today the system is more akin to social arbitrage: a constant and open exchange of favors and intelligence

> A successful mentoring relationship needs equal parts utility and emotion
