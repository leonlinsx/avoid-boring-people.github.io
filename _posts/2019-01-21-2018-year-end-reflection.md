title:  "2018 year end reflection questions"
tags: [reflection, learning, goals]

We don't reflect enough. While New Year's resolutions are a cultural norm, year end reflections seem to be much less discussed. Reflecting is difficult, but necessary to learn from the past. Ideally you'd be reflecting more regularly, and the end of 2018 provides a good excuse to start the habit.

Below are the questions I used for my 2018 reflection along with some rationale: 

1. What went well?
2. What am I proud of / what did I overcome?  
  * People tend to obsess over their mistakes. It's helpful for mental health to also take credit for your successes
3. What could have been improved?  
  * That said, knowing what you could have done better is also helpful. Importantly, focus on [bad processes rather than bad outcomes](http://michaelmauboussin.com/excerpts/MTYKexcerpt.pdf "Mauboussin on process vs outcome") 
4. What am I thankful for?  
  * Remember to be grateful for the opportunities you have. If these include friends and family, now's a great time to reach out 
5. What surprised me?
  * This is more for fun, since surprises are by definition unexpected, and I'm unsure how much you can learn from this. It might be helpful if you can identify a common theme in your surprises
6. What did I learn?
7. What needs to be left behind?
  * Letting go is difficult. Be aware of sunk costs and behaviours to avoid
8. How will I change?
9. Who will I connect with?
  * Both new and old
10. What are my goals? Of those, what are my top goals? 
  * [Buffett's advice](https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus "Buffett on focus") on goal setting is worth thinking about, though was just focused on career goals. Your list likely expands when including other aspects of life e.g. physical, leisure etc. I do agree with the principle that you can't focus on too many things at once
11. What can I look forward to?
  * End off with a positive note and think about what gets you excited about the year ahead
