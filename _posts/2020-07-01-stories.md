Let's start with a story about stories.

[Bestselling author Kurt Vonnegut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut "Kurt") is known for Slaughterhouse-Five, Cat's Cradle, and many other works. In his autobiography, [he claimed that this was his greatest contribution to culture:](https://books.google.com/books?id=Zd_9o3uyoVsC&pg=PA285&dq=vonnegut+shape+story+thesis&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tasCU8yjEML-oQSXloKIBQ#v=onepage&q=vonnegut%20shape%20story%20thesis&f=false "book")

So, *stories have shapes,* he says. 

What does that mean? Kurt explains \[1\]:

Imagine you had a graph, with good fortune and bad fortune on one side, and the other side plotting the progress of the story from beginning to end.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/shape story 2.png)

You could plot any story on this graph to see its shape. If you plotted all the stories in the world, there would be a couple of common patterns that emerge.

For example, in [The Godfather,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather "Godfather") Michael starts off happy, but the family gets into trouble and he is forced to leave the country. He eventually returns, plots to regain control, and finally kills most of his opposition to become the godfather of the city's mafia. We'll plot this on the graph and call it a "man in a hole" type of story. Man is doing well, falls in a hole, then gets out and is better than before.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/shape story 3.png)

On the other hand, in [About Time,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/About_Time_(2013_film) "About Time") \[2\] the main characters fall in love, lose each other, and then find each other again after a series of events. We'll call this a "boy meets girl" type of story. As you can imagine this is typical for many romance movies.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/shape story 4.png)

And in a story such as [The Metamorphosis,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis "Kafka") things just keep getting worse for our protagonist. This would be a "tragedy". 

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/shape story 5.png)

In addition to the shapes above, Kurt thought of a few more that could work. A "rags to riches" story could involve a steady rise, an ["icarus" story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus "icarus") could involve a rise and then a fall, and a ["oedipus" story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus "oedipus") could involve a fall, rise, and a fall again. 

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/shape story 6.png)

Building on this idea, [a team of researchers from Vermont and Adelaide used machine learning to classify 1,327 famous stories](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07772.pdf "paper") on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ "proj"), finding that the stories did indeed follow a few major types. See the footnote for more details on their methodology \[3\].

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/shape story 7.png)

They've replaced "boy meets girl" with "cinderella" here, but it essentially shows that Vonnegut was right \[4\]. Stories have shapes.

How is this relevant? You came here for stock tips and startup trash talk \[5\], what's up with all the notes about narratives? 

I'll make the link shortly, and for now let's just keep those story shapes in mind.

#### Stocks have shapes

Last month, we discussed one reason your investment pitch sucks: [you aren't accounting for consensus.](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/relatively-speaking-the-billionaire/comments "pitch")

This month, let's discuss another common reason that can be even more frustrating.

Consider this company as of Apr 30, 2018:

Company X is an internet company, mainly making money off app subscriptions in an expanding consumer category. It's growing revenue ~30% year over year. It has 7 million total subscribers, of which 3 million are subscribers of its main app. EBITDA (a type of earnings metric) margins are 40%. The stock price is at an all time high, having more than doubled in the past year \[6\].

Looks pretty good, maybe worth researching further to see if you'd want to own it.

Also consider the same company as of May 1, 2018:

Company X is an internet company, mainly making money off app subscriptions in an expanding consumer category. It's growing revenue ~30% year over year. It has 7 million total subscribers, of which 3 million are subscribers of its main app. EBITDA (a type of earnings metric) margins are 40%. The stock price is at an all time high, having more than doubled in the past year. *[Facebook just announced they're planning to enter the category](https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/01/facebook-dating/ "FB")*

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/MTCH 2.png)

The company's fundamentals haven't changed, but that 22% price decline within a day clearly shows *something* has. And that, of course, is the story that investors were telling about the stock. 

For what is a pitch, but a story about the stock? 

On Apr 30, the consensus pitch \[7\]

inflection point

Investors tell each other stories, and wait for those to turn true.

#### Startups have shapes

Companies tell us their stories, and we decide what we want to be true.

#### Self shaping

You can tell me a story, and it's up to you to make it true.

### Subscriber milestones and free postcards

I hit an internal goal for free subscribers since the last newsletter, which calls for a celebration. As some of you may know, I also love snail mail \[40\]. Reply directly to this with your address if you'd like to get a postcard! I'll cut it off after some arbitrary point where I'm too tired to send more so first come, first served here.

I haven't hit my internal goal for paid subs yet, so here's the semi-annual shameless self-promo. Did you know I write paid articles weekly? The articles are more random than the monthly, but join and read about [intuition behind neural networks](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/the-next-machine-learning-startup "net"), [the buyside investing tech stack](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/not-everything-is-insider-trading "buyside"), and [finding aliens](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/war-of-the-words "alien"). Happy to forward previews to anyone.

### Footnotes

1. Both in his autobiography, as well as his talk [here](https://youtu.be/GOGru_4z1Vc "Kurt")
2. I will not stop shilling this movie; it's one of my favourites
3. The full paper is [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07772.pdf "paper"). They used three methods in their analysis, and all showed similar results. These methods were Principal Component Analysis / Singular Value Decomposition, hierarchical clustering, and clustering with unsupervised machine learning. I'm unsure how exactly they used SVD, and it seems like they extracted the top features from a similarity matrix, and compared how much that explained the variance between story types. The hierarchical clustering seems to be a standard dendrogram to cluster the types of stories. The unsupervised machine learning used [Kohonen’s Self-Organizing Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map "SOM"), which looks to be an algorithm for clustering groups together, doing something like K means.
4. Technically, Vonnegut separates boy meets girl from cinderella, as cinderalla has a more stepwise buildup and a sharp drop before recovering. They're similar enough to me that I've grouped them together. Vonnegut also proposes a single flat line for stories such as Hamlet where "nothing happens". I disagree with such a shape, and have left that out for simplicity. For a different take on the types of stories, [Christopher Booker discusses seven basic plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Basic_Plots "seven")
5. Please do not have come here for stock tips and startup trash talk, you'll be disappointed that I do not do the former and only occasionally do the latter.
6. 8K for the company [here](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001575189/63f15bf6-7324-446e-b762-fb1ac98ccf14.pdf "MTCH"), though you'll spoil the surprise.
7. Let's ignore what the shorts were saying for simplicity, the price performance implies people were bullish.
40. A writer likes to get writing? Gasp.
