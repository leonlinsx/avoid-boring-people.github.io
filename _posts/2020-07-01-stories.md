Let me tell you a story about stories.

[Bestselling author Kurt Vonnegut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut "Kurt") is most well known for Slaughterhouse-Five. In his autobiography, [he claimed that this was his greatest contribution to culture:](https://books.google.com/books?id=Zd_9o3uyoVsC&pg=PA285&dq=vonnegut+shape+story+thesis&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tasCU8yjEML-oQSXloKIBQ#v=onepage&q=vonnegut%20shape%20story%20thesis&f=false "book")

So, *stories have shapes,* he says. 

What does that mean? Kurt explains \[1\]:

Imagine you had a graph, with good fortune and bad fortune on one side, and the other side plotting the progress of the story from beginning to end.

You could plot any story on this graph to see its shape. If you plotted all the stories in the world, there would be a couple of common patterns that emerge.

For example, in [The Godfather,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather "God") Michael starts off happy, but the family gets into trouble and he is forced to leave the country. He eventually returns, plotting to regain control, and eventually kills most of his opposition as he takes over as the godfather of the city's mafia. We'll plot this on the graph and call it a "man in a hole" type of story. Man is doing well, falls in a hole, then gets out and is better than before.

On the other hand, in [The Princess Bride,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_(film) "Prince") the main characters fall in love, lose each other, and then find each other again after a series of adventures. We'll call this a "boy meets girl" type of story. As you can imagine this is typical for many romance movies.

And in a story such as [The Metamorphosis,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis "Kafka") things just keep getting worse for our protagonist. This would be a "tragedy"
