Writing is selfish. 

Well, perhaps not all writing. If you're writing for yourself and never intend for anyone to read it, you're an exception \[1\]. But the majority of writing is intended for someone else to read and respond to. Whether that be a paper at school, email at work, or self-referential blog post on your web site, you're yelling to get your audience's attention, with the purpose usually to inform, entertain, or persuade \[2\]. When you want someone to read something you wrote, you're forcing your ideas into their mind. You're stealing their time, their most precious commodity. Content creation is also attention appropriation.

Not all writing shouts at you with the same intensity. That school paper which you've used [double spacing after each fullstop](https://www.instructionalsolutions.com/blog/one-space-vs-two-after-period "spacing"), [increased the font size of punctuation marks](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/743goz/ulpt_coming_up_short_on_the_length_of_your_essay/ "punctuation font"), and [messed with the line spacing between lines](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-the-line-spacing-in-word-1970e24a-441c-473d-918f-c6805237fbf4 "line spacing") is a weak whimper, created to fulfil some criteria and hopefully never referenced again once you've been graded. But good writing, great writing, comes at you with a ferocity and intensity like a storm at sea, demanding your complete focus \[3\]. Little of our writing is going to be good, and even less will be great, but we still write with the hope that our intended recipient glances at it. We want that theft of your time. We want to be read. 

Yet we have to face the inconvenient reality that most of our writing goes unread. We shout into the abyss, but the abyss doesn't shout back \[4\]. It's deathly quiet. Take Howard Marks's [experience with his now-famous memos:](https://ritholtz.com/2018/10/mib-howard-marks-oaktree-capital/ "Marks story"):

> Marks is known for his Chairman’s Memos that he has been his creative outlet since 1990. He describes the first decade of printing them — literally on paper, inserting them into stamped envelopes and physically mailing them off into the world — where he received precisely zero response. “We didn’t even know if anyone got them.”

How then, do we handle this sad situation? [Marks explains how he dealt with this:](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/selfish-writing/ "Marks story 2")

> The answer I think is that I was writing for myself. Number one, it’s creative, I enjoy the writing process. Number two I thought that the topics were interesting and that I wanted to put them on paper. Number three, writing makes you tighten up your thinking.

and Morgan Housel follows up with his own thoughts:

> Writing is the ultimate test of whether your thoughts make sense or are merely gut feelings. Feelings about why something is the way it is don’t need to be questioned or analyzed in your head because they feel good and you don’t want to rock the boat.

Thus, we should write for ourselves first and foremost. This particularly applies in non-fiction writing, where we're discussing an idea. Formalising our vague thoughts concretely helps us identify weak spots in our understanding. You'll have encountered that feeling before when elaborating your idea on paper and discovering a logical gap, or when [explaining something to someone else and realising you don't understand the topic as well as you thought.](https://strategyumwelt.com/frameworks/feynman-technique?rq=feynman%20technique "feynman technique") Having an audience is awesome, and feedback is fantastic, but we should write without the assumption anyone will be interested in what we have to say. Writing for ourselves is helpful enough, and any other benefits are positive surprises. Note that I'm not saying to avoid publicity, but that publicity is a bonus and should not be your primary driver. If it is, I fear you'll burn out quickly.

Which brings me to the point of this post, which is to explain my reasons for starting this blog \[5\]. I've briefly described my rationale [in my about section](https://www.leonlinsx.com/about-me/), which coincidentally is similar to the reasons discussed above \[6\]. For me, the act of writing itself is helpful to organise my thoughts, reflect on inconsistencies, and synthesise information. A few years ago, I started compiling interesting things I'd come across and emailing these to friends. Of course, I was hoping that I was adding value to them, but the main benefit to me was and still is the forced recording of the information for me. Whenever someone talks about an issue I've written about before, my default is to send them the relevant email as a follow up \[7\] . As the years went by I added more people to the list, and even gotten thoughtful replies to the content that furthered my understanding. I like to comfort myself with the thought that noone has asked to drop off the list yet, though I'm wondering how much of that is a combination of (1) feeling too awkward to ask and (2) not even reading the email in the first place. Wonder which I should feel worse about...

With the email system going well, why did I decide to set up a public blog then? I was nudged initially by a friend, and became more serious about it after a change in personal circumstances. These were the pros and cons that factored into my decision:

**Pros:**
1. Easier searching and categorisation of my content. I'd be able to tag and find posts by category, and could more easily forward them to whoever was interested
2. Accountability for my thoughts. Putting my opinion out there would force me to be accountable \[8\]. You might have noticed the conviction level disclaimer in front of the newer posts, a method I'm testing to calibrate the accuracy of my beliefs. I'm mostly ranking conviction level in steps of 20%, with the occassional 5% or 95% cop-out. For me, I think getting more granular than that would be false precision for myself
3. Build my personal brand. This will be the topic of another post, but I believe that there's a trend of individualisation as more people move away from work and company oriented identities to becoming their own brand, such as the influencer movement in marketing
4. Force me to learn a tiny bit of technical knowledge to set up the site as I wanted it to look
5. Low (20%?) chance of the content reaching a larger audience and getting to learn from the increased feedback
6. Even lower (5%) chance of the blog reaching an audience at scale

**Cons:**
1. Setting up whatever site I was using could be annoying and time consuming. Will elaborate on my difficulties faced below
2. The permanence of public content would mean that I could be liable for a controversial opinion I post here
3. Potential [doxxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing "wiki") of my private information and general harrassment. I've been reluctant to post private details on my own social media, so creating a public site runs opposite to this behaviour
4. Abandoning this blog after running out of the initial wave of motivation
5. Running out of good material to write and then having to churn out bad material to hit my 1 year target

Come to think of it \[9\], I should have used a [decision journal framework](https://fs.blog/2014/02/decision-journal/ "decision journal") to document this, but I guess that's a missed opportunity. However, the above pros/cons list was enough to convince me that I should at least attempt to start a site, and see how I liked the experience. This goes back to what I've discussed about liking the idea of something vs liking actually doing it. After thinking through the above, it was time for me to find out, and I started looking into how to get started.

**All that said, here are some predictions:**
* 80% odds of this blog having minimal following (<100 readers) in 1 year
* 20% odds of this blog reaching a sizeable following (>1000 readers) in 3 years
* 5% odds of this blog having a post that's widely shared (>1000 readers) in 1 year
* 80% odds of this blog still being updated in 1 year
* 60% odds of this blog still being updated in 3 years

As you can see, I'm not placing good odds on the popularity of this site. Perhaps that's a natural hedge, but I think that going through the process of thinking, writing, and revising my thoughts is probably the biggest likely outcome for this experiment. And that's enough reason to do it.

At the end of the day, my writing is for me alone. 

My writing is selfish. 

**Footnotes**
1. Diaries are probably the big exception here, though even the best selling diary was written [with intent on publication,](https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/go-in-depth/two-versions-annes-diary/ "anne frank two versions") which was surprising for me to learn about. I don't have stats on the proportion of publicly written material vs privately written material, but would assume the majority of material written is intended for others to read. Even [writers famous for being reclusive](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/the-late-harper-lee-and-five-other-reclusive-authors/ "reclusive authors") still ended up publishing their work. There's a selection bias here, since they're famous becuase they were published, but I think people are writing to be read. This [list of quotes](https://www.aerogrammestudio.com/2014/03/27/why-i-write-23-quotes-famous-authors/ "why i write quotes") by famous authors on why they write is relevant to browse through
2. The "author's purpose", as some of us might have been taught. Interesting to note that a quick search on author purpose's turns up [different](http://www.mdc.edu/kendall/collegeprep/documents2/author's%20purposerev818.pdf "purpose 1") [categorisations](https://www.lancasterschools.org/cms/lib/NY19000266/Centricity/Domain/451/B1.pdf "purpose 2"), though most overlap to some degree
3. Great writing [stays with you](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/88ike0/whats_your_favorite_quote_from_a_book/). 
4. A butchering of the meaning of a [quote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche "abyss") but I think serves to make my point. I believe this applies both to school, work, and published writing. Think about how often you yourself have skimmed a paper, scanned an email, or just glanced at the headline of an article. I believe most writing is never read in full.
5. Talk about [burying the lead huh](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/bury-the-lede-versus-lead "lede or lead")
6. I hadn't read either Marks's or Morgan's comments prior to setting up this blog; I came across them before writing this post in a convenient coincidence
7. Admittedly lazy, though I suppose some self-promotion doesn't hurt
8. Also echoed by [Fred](https://avc.com/2019/03/being-wrong/ "being wrong") and [Howard](http://howardlindzon.com/where-were-you-on-march-9-2009/ "where were you") on their blogs
9. Real time example of how writing helps in thinking better
