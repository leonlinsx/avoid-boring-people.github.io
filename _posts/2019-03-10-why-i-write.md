Writing is selfish. 

Well, perhaps not all writing. If you're writing for yourself and never intend for anyone to read it, you're an exception \[1\]. But the majority of writing is intended for someone else to read and respond to. Whether that be a paper at school, email at work, or self-referential blog post on your web site, you're yelling to get your audience's attention, with the purpose usually to inform, entertain, or persuade \[2\]. When you want someone to read something you wrote, you're forcing your ideas into their mind. You're stealing their time, their most precious commodity. Content creation is also attention appropriation.

Of course, not all writing shouts at you with the same intensity. That school paper which you've used [double spacing after each fullstop](https://www.instructionalsolutions.com/blog/one-space-vs-two-after-period "spacing"), [increased the font size of punctuation marks](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/743goz/ulpt_coming_up_short_on_the_length_of_your_essay/ "punctuation font"), and [messed with the line spacing between lines](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-the-line-spacing-in-word-1970e24a-441c-473d-918f-c6805237fbf4 "line spacing") is a weak whimper, created to fulfil some criteria and hopefully never referenced again once you've been graded. But good writing, great writing, comes at you with a ferocity and intensity like a storm at sea, demanding your complete focus. Little of our writing is going to be good, and even less will be great, but we still write with the hope that our intended recipient glances at it. We want that theft of your time. We want to be read. 

Yet we have to face the inconvenient reality that most of our writing goes unread. We shout into the abyss, but the abyss doesn't shout back \[3\]. It's deathly quiet. Take Howard Marks's [experience with his now-famous memos:](https://ritholtz.com/2018/10/mib-howard-marks-oaktree-capital/ "Marks story"):

> Marks is known for his Chairman’s Memos that he has been his creative outlet since 1990. He describes the first decade of printing them — literally on paper, inserting them into stamped envelopes and physically mailing them off into the world — where he received precisely zero response. “We didn’t even know if anyone got them.”

How then, do we handle this sad situation? [Marks explains how he dealt with this:](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/selfish-writing/ "Marks story 2")

> The answer I think is that I was writing for myself. Number one, it’s creative, I enjoy the writing process. Number two I thought that the topics were interesting and that I wanted to put them on paper. Number three, writing makes you tighten up your thinking.

and Morgan Housel follows up with his own thoughts:

> Writing is the ultimate test of whether your thoughts make sense or are merely gut feelings. Feelings about why something is the way it is don’t need to be questioned or analyzed in your head because they feel good and you don’t want to rock the boat.

Thus, we should write for ourselves first and foremost, especially in non-fiction writing where we're discussing an idea. Formalising our vague thoughts concretely helps us identify weak spots in our understanding. You'll have encountered that feeling before when elaborating your idea on paper and discovering a logical gap, or when explaining something to someone else and realising you don't understand the topic as well as you thought. Having an audience is awesome, and feedback is fantastic, but we should write without the assumption anyone will be interested in what we have to say. Writing for ourselves is helpful already, and any benefits above that are positive surprises. Note that I'm not saying to avoid publicity, but that publicity is a bonus and should not be your primary driver. If it is, I fear you'll burn out quickly.

Which brings me to the point of this post, which is to explain my reasons for starting this blog. I've [briefly described](https://www.leonlinsx.com/about-me/) my stance, which  \[4\]

A few years ago, I started compiling interesting things I'd come across and emailing my thoughts to friends.  

Some predictions:
* 80% odds of this blog having minimal following (<100 readers) in 1 year
* 20% odds of this blog reaching a sizeable following (>1000 readers) in 3 years
* 5% odds of this blog having a post that's widely shared (>1000 readers) in 1 year
* 80% odds of this blog still being updated in 1 year
* 60% odds of this blog still being updated in 3 years

As you can see, I'm not placing good odds on the popularity of this site. Perhaps that's a natural hedge, but I think that going through the process of thinking, writing, and revising my thoughts is probably the biggest likely outcome for this experiment.

At the end of the day, my writing is for me alone. 

My writing is selfish. 


**Footnotes**
1. Diaries are probably the big exception here, though even the best selling diary was written [with intent on publication,](https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/go-in-depth/two-versions-annes-diary/ "anne frank two versions") which was surprising for me to learn about. I don't have stats on the proportion of publicly written material vs privately written material, but would assume the majority of material written is intended for others to read. Even [writers famous for being reclusive](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/the-late-harper-lee-and-five-other-reclusive-authors/ "reclusive authors") still ended up publishing their work. There's a selection bias here, since they're famous becuase they were published, but I think people are writing to be read.
2. The "author's purpose", as some of us might have been taught. Interesting to note that a quick search on author purpose's turns up [different](http://www.mdc.edu/kendall/collegeprep/documents2/author's%20purposerev818.pdf "purpose 1") [categorisations](https://www.lancasterschools.org/cms/lib/NY19000266/Centricity/Domain/451/B1.pdf "purpose 2"), though most overlap to some degree
3. A butchering of the meaning of a [quote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche "abyss") but I think serves to make my point. I believe this applies both to school, work, and published writing. Think about how often you yourself have skimmed a paper, scanned an email, or just glanced at the headline of an article. I believe most writing is never read in full.
4. Talk about burying the lead huh
