## Main

> He was also worried that he and Andreessen were opening the floodgates to frivolity and junk. "And I was right! People abused it horribly," \[Mosaic cocreator\] Bina said later. "But Marc was also right. As a result of the glitz and glitter, thousands of people wasted time to put in pretty pictures and valuable information on the Web, and millions of people use it."

> Netscape benefited as teh underlying platform that was the most trusted and valued by users \[...\] Netscape would even encourage others to build add-ons and plugins that would interact with Netscape's own software, adding features and functions that Netscape itself couldn't dream up.
 
> Andreesen was quoted saying that Netscape would turn Windows into "a mundane collection of not entirely debugged device drivers."

> The web, by contrast, allowed users to consume content, and create it. Any user. Anywhere. Any kind of content.

> eBay was one of the first websites to show that a largely anonymous community, carefully constrained by a few guidelines and regulations, but invested in a system of online reputation, could actually work

> The well-worn legend is that Jeff Bezos and his wife MacKenzie packed up their car and headed west, unsure of where they were going, with Jeff typing up a business plan on his laptop as they drove and phoning angel investors along the way on his cell phone. But the truth is, Bezos had already flown out to California to recruit software engineering talent. And according to multiple accounts, he likely knew the destination of his cross-country car trip would be Seattle.
