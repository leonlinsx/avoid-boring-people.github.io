Flexibility

Openness

Pride

Responsibility

> The meaning of life is that it is to be lived, and it is not to be traded and conceptualised and squeezed into a pattern of systems

> We are always in a process of becoming and **nothing** is fixed. Have no rigid system in you, and you'll be flexible to change with the ever changing. Open yourself and flow, my friend. Flow in the total openness of the living moment.

> You know how water fills a cup? It **becomes** that cup.

> What **is** is more important than **what should be**. Too many people are looking at "what is" from a position of "what should be"

> A human being is the result of a marriage of natural instinct and control. You are to combine the two in harmony. If you have one to the extreme you will be very unscientific; if you have another to the extreme, you become a mechanical man, no longer a human being. 

> The mind must be wide open in order to function freely in thought. For a limited mind cannot think freely. 

> It is the ego that stands rigidly against things coming from the outside, and it is this "ego rigidity" that makes it impossible for us to accept everything that confronts us.

> There is fear and insecurity in pride, for when one aims at being highly esteemed, and having achieved such status, he is automaticallly involved in the fear of losing one's status. Then protection of his status appears to be his most important need, and this creates anxiety.

> In order to realise our true self we must be willing to live wihtout being dependent upon the opinion of others. When we are completely self-sufficient we can have no fear of not being esteemed by others

> What does self-willed mean? Hell, isn't it knowing above all, that, indeed, one is the captain of one's soul, the master of one's life? **To be real, to accept responsibility for oneself**

> A self-willed man has no other aim than his own growth. 

> Many people are still bound by tradition; when the elder generation says "no" to something, then these other people will strongly disapprove of it as well. They seldom use their mind to find out the truth and seldom express sincerely their real feeling. The simple truth is that these opinions on such things as racism are traditions, which are nothing more than a "formula" laid down by these elder people's experience. As we progress and time changes, it is necessary to reform this formula.

> What is defeat? Nothing but education; nothing but the first step to something better.

> Without frustration you will not discover that you might be able to do something on your own. We grow through conflict.

> Not failure, but low aim, is the crime. In great attempts it is glorious even to fail.

> To realise that it's just an inconvenience, that it is not a catastrophe, but just an unpleasantness, is part of coming into your own, part of waking up

> At one time I wanted all the indirect things - money, fame, the big opening nights. Now I have it, or am beginning to get it, the whole thing doesn't seem important any more. I have found that doing a thing is more important. I am having fun doing it

> Each person must not be limited to one approach. We must approach it with our own self - we are always in a learning process, whereas a "style" is a concluded, established, solidified something. You cannot do that, because you learn every day as you grow older. 

> Man, the living creature, the creating individual, is always more important than any established style or system. 

> It is not daily increase but daily decrease - hack away the unessential! The closer to the source, the less wastage there is

> It is indeed difficult to convery simplicity

> The basic theory in yin-yang is that nothing is so permanent as never to change. In other words, when activity (yang) reaches the extreme point, it becomes inactivity, and inactivity forms yin.

> Truth is not to be found in a book. Furthermore, such a book merely presents a barrier to progress in your search for truth. Independent inquiry is needed in your seaerch for truth, not dependence on anyone else's view or a mere book

> From now on drop all your burden of preconceived conclusions behind, and "open" yourself to everything and everyone ahead. Remember, my friend, the usefulness of a cup is in its emptiness.
