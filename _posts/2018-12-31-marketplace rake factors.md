I liked Josh’s rake factors article because it was the first I’ve seen that attempts to build up fundamental reasons for why a rake is set at a certain percentage, rather than just ‘because comps are at that rake’. To be fair, some markets are indeed just priced based on comps but I still like the framework.
 
I had some additional thoughts:
There are some marketplaces that seem to be exceptions to this framework (which Josh caveats is not definitive)
E.g. the stock photography market has always been curious to me. The rake there can be >50%, an incredible amount for a service that has so many competitors (https://microstockinsider.com/microstock_commission_rates), transparent fees, little marginal costs on the platform side.
E.g. China marketplace rakes are very low when compared to US marketplaces. Taobao’s rake is ~4% vs Ebay 9%
I think adding another factor of +3% for ‘promotional activity’ on the platform might be helpful
E.g. how booking.com lets advertisers become preferred members with better placement for 300bps
E.g. a hotel loyalty program averages about 3% in cost for the hotel
E.g. alibaba’s Taobao marketplace rev is from marketing activities, and the average cost is ~4%
E.g. the seamless rake used to go from 12.5% to 20%, a difference of 7.5% which is
higher than 3%, but the average restaurant would be paying 15%+ and not the lowest rake
Ubereats will probably charge a couple percentage points for promotional placement as wellhttps://techcrunch.com/2018/12/10/uber-ads/
I think that companies coming into a market intending to undercut their competitor also set their take rate 5%-10% lower than the prevailing incumbent
E.g. how booking.com came in with 10% or more lower than expedia and won the market that wayhttps://skift.com/2012/06/25/how-booking-com-conquered-world/
E.g. seatgeek’s rates seems to be 5%+ lower than the incumbent stubhub
E.g. the smaller Chinese OTAs are ~10% rake vs main OTA 15% rake
I haven’t seen many rakes >20% that are sustained over time. Similarly to how Bill Gurley talks about rakes too far, there’s something about that threshold that pulls take rates down over time. My hypothesis is that it starts eating too much into the customer’s COGS
E.g. For the longest time, iOS, google play store rakes were 30%. Then they started introducing lower rakes for subscriptions
E.g. Steam used to have a 30% rake, and that now trends downwards for larger publishers. Not a coincidence with Epic Games and Discord coming out with their own 10%+ rake stores instead
I think take rates are also influenced by the gross margins of the sellers on the platform, though I’m still working on how to frame this
E.g. food delivery platforms can’t charge much higher than 30%, if not the restaurants don’t make money
E.g. air ticket take rates are essentially 0% since the airlines both consolidated and also have thin margins
How should we treat platforms that charge both the seller and the buyer? I personally have something against them as a consumer but seems there’s no pressure to change that yet
As Ruzwana mentioned, perhaps more infrequent, episodic transactions can support buyer fees, but not frequent, regular transaction cases https://twitter.com/daveambrose/status/694921246799073280
E.g. Airbnb, ticketing market, dog vacation
To a lesser extent, the food delivery platforms pass through delivery fees but don’t make money on it, and when Postmates tried to do it seems to have been an impediment to growth
 
As a sidenote, here are some take rate benchmarking I did, compared to his framework:
Booking.com take rate 20% + 10% opaque fees + 5% quality control + 5% fraud prevention – 10% high price items – 10% users meet in person? = 20% vs 14% actual rake
Other main OTA: expedia is around 13-18% actual, ctrip is around 10-15% actual on hotel inventory
Smaller chinese competitors meituan are at 8-10%, and tongcheng is ~9%
Etsy take rate 20% - 5% transparent fees - 5% buyer beware = 10% vs 5% actual
Farfetch take rate 20% + 10% work on platform + 5% quality control + 5% fraud prevention – 5% transparent fees – 5% high price items = 30% vs 33% actual
Taobao take rate 20% + 10% work on platform – 5% transparent fees – 5% buyer beware = 20% vs 4% actual
Tmall take rate 20% + 10% work on platform + 5% quality control – 5% transparent fees – 5% buyer beware = 25% vs 3%+ actual
JD.com is about 8% actual
Mercado libre take rate is about 17% actual
Taobao, Tmall, JD all seem to not fit the framework. I think it has to do with China’s market, and how Taobao was initially started as a platform with 0 fees. So the base is to start at 0% rather than 20%
Stubhub/Seatgeek take rate 20% + 10% opaque fees + 5% quality control + 5% fraud prevention - 5% high price items = 35% vs 40%+ actual
