Many things seem obvious to people in an industry but are not to people outside of it. The list below may seem cynical; I prefer the term realistic. As always, open to being proven wrong.

1. Companies don't get value when talking with investment bankers about M&A since the companies know the landscape better. Financing structuring is more relevant but also becoming commoditised. 
2. Investors don't get value from sellside equity research since the published work is by definition consensus. Most value the company connections instead.
3. Earnings calls are public, but most companies also hold private calls with sellside research after the public one.
4. Investors meet with company management all the time, and this is totally legal
