*"Who I am is where I stand... Where I stand is where I fall" â€“ The 13th Doctor, in [The Doctor Falls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnouj9Yz-Gs "speech youtube link")*

Know where you stand. Not just a fascinating [art exhibition](https://www.sethtaras.com/KNOW-WHERE-YOU-STAND/ "photo link"), but also interesting advice, not just for self-reflection, but also for more critical reading.

I've seen more writers state what their beliefs are, which I think is a great idea. See examples from [PressThink](http://pressthink.org/2017/12/show-work-new-terms-trust-journalism/ "Show your work"), [The Interface](https://www.theverge.com/pages/theinterface "The Interface"), or [Devon Zuegel](https://devonzuegel.com/page/about-me "About Me"). Understanding the context behind someone is helpful towards knowing how much credibility to put behind their statements. Even for those striving to avoid bias, it's nearly impossible to give your opinion without being letting your background affect your judgement. Laying out your principles helps improve not just transparency but also accountability.

I had to go through this process while setting up my own [About Me Page](https://www.leonlinsx.com/about-me/ "About Me"), and it took longer than I expected. What did I really believe in? Why was that the case? How do my beliefs complement or contradict each other? 

For those that haven't had the chance to think about what they believe in, I encourage taking some time to reflect on this. It's likely best to write out your beliefs. It's easy to think about topics in your head, but writing them out in full seems to be harder, especially once you realise you have inconsistent beliefs. I think that coming to this realisation is important, even if you don't know how to resolve the contradiction. At least you have now learnt something new about yourself.  

It's ok not to know where you stand on some issues. Some topics you may be unqualified to have an opinion on because you don't have enough background knowledge. Similarly, I think that knowing which areas these are is also important. As I've [written before](https://www.leonlinsx.com/dunning-on-dunning-kruger/ "I don't know"), too many people want to avoid saying that they don't know. I think this is unconducive for actually learning and getting better. We have to put our ego aside.
