Imagine a building. Perhaps the office you work in, or the house you live in. What parts of that building change over time? How quickly do they change?

The stuff in the rooms change all the time. You buy the new Amazon Echo, you [throw away the old lamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBqhIVyfsRg "lamp"). Change is constant and frequent.

The space plan, or interior layout, changes less frequently. Perhaps your office finally puts up a wall between your desk and the bathroom, the day after you leave the company. Or you decide to convert your spare bedroom into a XX. Change here is intermittent and less frequent.

The services within, your plumbing, electricity, gas, and more, change even less frequently. So does the skin, or exterior of the building. Those might not even change before you move out of the place.

The structure, or [skeleton](https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Skeleton_frame "skeleton") rarely changes, unless part of a renovation or deconstruction.

And the site of the building itself, that geography essentially stays the same. 

The above is the concept of how buildings learn and evolve, proposed by Stewart Brand of the [Long Now Foundation](http://longnow.org/ "Long Now") \[1\]. 

In 1999 Stewart further extended the framework to apply to civilisations. What parts of civilisation change over time? How quickly do they change? How do they interact?
