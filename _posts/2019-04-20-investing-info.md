My own investment framework will forever be a work in progress \[1\], but one important issue I'll have to address is the purpose of information in investing, and how to treat new information. I've [written before](https://www.leonlinsx.com/AI-and-investing/ "Huber") about John Huber's framework for [sources of edge in investing](http://basehitinvesting.com/what-is-your-edge/ "edge"), and one of the three edges he cites is informational advantage. Theoretically, if you have more or better information than others, you have an edge in investing and should outperform over time. 

A large portion of professional investing time is spent on acquiring information, whether through [management meetings](https://www.morganstanley.com/Themes/tech-media-telecom-trends-insights-outlook "investor conferences"), [expert network calls](https://www.alphasights.com/ "alphasights"), or the entire ["alternative data" industry](https://www.credenceresearch.com/report/alternative-data-market "alt data") \[2\]. Trading on insider information has long been a ~~feature~~ problem with markets \[3\], resulting in [various attempts to curb it](https://insidertrading.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=002391 "insider trading timeline") \[4\]. So it would seem that people believe information is valuable, and the more of it the better.

Leaving aside whether you believe you have more information than your competition, does having more information help you make better investment decisions? [This post](https://behaviouralinvestment.com/2019/01/09/can-more-information-lead-to-worse-investment-decisions/amp/ "behavioural investment") cites studies showing that [although individuals have increased confidence with increased information, their accuracy of outcomes doesn't change:](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dfe1/e71649951fc8aeda52eac460976bfe02f305.pdf "Tsai, C. I., Klayman, J., & Hastie, R. 2008")

The Tsai, Klayman, Hastie study with the graph above cites two main reasons for the divergence:

> judges show insufficient correction for the effects of cue redundancy as information accumulates. Thus, they tend to overestimate the incremental predictive value of additional information.

> Confirmation biases may be another important source of divergence between confidence and accuracy



**Footnotes**
1. Both a combination of always learning something new and ~~laziness~~ the difficulty in writing all of it out. I am planning to post about it in the future though to refine my thoughts. [Just not yet](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/18iyw2/til_that_st_augustine_of_hippo_a_father_of_the/ "later")
2. For example, [credit card transactions](http://sandalwoodadvisors.com/ "sandalwood"), [app usage data](https://www.appannie.com/en/ "appannie"), or [search data](https://www.semrush.com/ "SEM")
3. And likely still is, depending on who you talk to and how cynical they are. The general public seems fascinated by [high profile cases of suspected insider trading](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32284263-black-edge "black edge"), and beyond the [blatantly illegal golf course tip](https://nypost.com/2017/07/27/phil-mickelsons-pal-gets-5-years-fined-10m-for-insider-trading/ "phil") there's a large grey area of "let's jump on the phone" interactions that happen daily.
4. Current laws are somewhat ambiguous in dealing with insider trading, but as [Matt Levine writes](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-02-01/some-trades-are-shady-not-all-are-illegal "levine"), the law is more about theft rather than fairness.
