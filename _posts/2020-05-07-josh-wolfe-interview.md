- teaching underappreciated.
  - hard to do
  - but also daycare
- absurd has become the normal
- positive side is this has allowed us to be more together
  - people contributing to teach each other, communities
  - debates with people taking the view that opposes theirs
- When you don't have resources, necessity is mother of invention
  - find a lot of entrepreneurs have to hack things together
  - you have limited resources and are trying to cobble something together
  - when you are well resourced you just call a department to get what you need
  - scarcity is a virture
- Santa Fe institute has put out great material on current situation
  - Transmission of virus, biologically, which is independent of what people believe
  - Transmission of information
- Many different layers all fiercely reacting to each other
  - Biology
  - Political
  - Economic
- Huge disconnect between the real economy and what the market believes
  - when i look at economic destruction that is permanent, particularly for time to rebuild for SMB, don't think that's fully appreciated
  - big businesses will be fine
  - lost so many jobs so quickly compared to how we created them
  - Ripple effect masked by massive federal intervention
- sets up situation where I can see two kinds of companies emerging that dominate:
  - 1980's europe, many effectively state-owned companies e.g. Total in France. Feel we could see a large company becoming a sacrifice here, leading to wave of semi-nationalisation. These companies could do well with the implicit support, access to cheap capital, government backing 
  - Less tourist capital in private markets, 
- What's underappreciated is the restart of the economy, more asymmetric in crashing vs building
- What do you think would be different had this crisis occurred 10 years in the future?
  - Distributed healthcare
    - A lot of companies experimenting with distributed in person medicine. Things that you wouldn't have to go to a physical center and can get remotely instead. What would have been a high end diagnostic tool for imaging will be more distributed; everyone will have one the way we have a thermometer
  - Distribution of logistics
    - More robots and automation the more effectively you can route goods, like how routers route bits.
    - How do you solve the last 100 feet problem, not just the last mile. Every home is different, might still require humans
    - Perhaps something like Latch will let you trust people to enter your house and place things
- There's a tradeoff between liberty and public health in the short term
  - Have to be cautious since some small liberties once given away don't come back, e.g. security screenings post 9-11
- How do you see this playing out?
  - I see two extremes of locking down vs letting everyone go back to normal. Both these extremes of complete lockdown and complete back to normal are unlikely
  - This state we're in (as of Apr 30) is a tolerably intolerable situation for a period of time, but not forever. Perhaps 4 weeks?
  - There will be a difference between how the dense cities react vs other areas
    - The greatest economic centers are also the ones most hard hit
    - When you're in a city you get far more of the good during normal times but also more of the bad
    - Think between now and Jun 1, using NYC as a proxy, by Jun 1 NYC will be "open" at 30% of normal density. Subways may be different story though
    - By Jun 15 there may be reports that NYC is at lower density and that'll induce people to start coming back
    - Then you'll get this pendulum effect of density going up and down
    - That's the optimistic case, though when I discuss this with Andrew he thinks I'm crazy
    - The difference in how cities vs other areas react will frustrate the people in cities
  - College towns will start to open earlier
    - Testing everyone, not having large classes
    - Interesting thing about college towns is they have cultural vibrancy of cities but without the density concerns
    - Could see migration of older people and retirees around college towns to be around that vibrancy
    - Also see some percentage of colleges disappearing in the next five years
    - Repurposing of assets that die out particularly around college towns
- How should we think about welfare and Universal Basic Income (UBI) in the modern world?
  - Media is doing a good job on bringing spotlight on some of worst hit people who do not have resources
  - Disproportionate effect on less well off communities, action needed to provide a safety net. This is the most urgent social program that needs to be put in place by cities
  - Think there's a moral obligation to society to provide basic support to some
  - Beyond moral, there's also a purely academic and draconian reson. If you don't provide support now there'll be costs later
  - Technological displacement is real in the short term. In the long term it creates all sorts of jobs people can't imagine
  - There's a lot of latent pricing power in some companies e.g. spectrum that could have raised prices but didn't due to fear of backlash. And when they do, that'll result in others coming to provide competing services
  - I'm bullish on areas that haven't raised pricing, and when the incumbents do it'll create whitespace for new companies
- Individuals have a moral responsibility to learn and level themselves up, and it's never been easier for them to do that
- Technological onshoring will be critical, I'm bullish on it
  - From security and geopolitical perspective will be more popular 
  - Will have redundancy, greater distribution, more onshoring
  - Should sacrifice the efficienty to get more slack in the system
- How has your investment thesis involved? Do you have any being driven by Covid?
  - We've tracked this, about 20 out of the 130 or so Lux companies that are directly impacted, whether 3D printing swabs or scanning physical spaces
  - All of that has been totally unintentional, nothing we're doing purposely for Covid
  - Believe vast majority of VC will be investing in telepresence spacce so I'm not interested in that
- Spotlight of our attention now is on Covid, and all the stuff outside of that is going to be important
  - The same way how in a heist movie the robbers will do a test to gauge initial response
  - If you're a back actor you've seen what the first response is
