**Main**

[Josh Wolfe](https://luxcapital.com/team/josh-wolfe/ "Josh") is a venture capitalist (VC) at Lux Capital, which invests in early-stage ventures that are "at the outermost edges of what is possible". Examples include [drone sentry security systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmI4Bwks2bg "Anduril"), [brain machine interfaces](https://luxcapital.com/companies/ctrl-labs/ "Ctrl"), and [3D data platforms](https://luxcapital.com/companies/matterport/ "3D") \[1\]. Josh has become more well known the past few years due to his less conventional way of thinking and his communications.

Josh was recently interviewed [here](https://vimeo.com/414116322 "Michael") by Michael Milstein, founder of [Company,](https://www.company.co/about-us/ "Company") a curated community of NYC startups and entreprenuers. I was going to do a summary of that talk, but realised Josh was also separately interviewed [here](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/33-josh-wolfe-the-mind-financing-the-future/id1469999563?i=1000473458522 "Eric") by [Eric Weinstein](https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein?s=20 "Eric"), managing director at Thiel Capital, the investment firm founded by Peter Thiel \[2\]. I'm going to respond to both talks below, combining ideas from each where appropriate, and paraphrasing throughout. 

The talks covered:

- Description of the current covid situation
- Predictions on covid related consequences
- Predictions on general future state of the world
- How he thinks of the VC space and what he looks for
- The search for meaning

 **Current situation**

- The hardest thing for most people to deal with now is the kids 
  - It's easier for us as adults to adjust but harder for them when missing out on the social aspect of school
  - As most of us have come to realise, teaching is underappreciated 
    - It's not just hard to do at an individual and classroom level
    - But it's also a form of daycare
  - If you recall that funny [BBC interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4f9AYRCZY "bbc") of the kids walking in on a parent, we were all laughing because it was absurd
    - Now, absurd has become the normal
    
*LL - For more thoughts on how education could change because of this, see [my recent recap of Megan O'Connor's views](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/how-online-credentialing-will-be "Megan")
    
- Positive side of this is that it's allowed us to be more together
  - People are contributing to teach each other, communities are forming
  - For example, we are isolating with a friend's household. Our households are doing debates with people taking the view that opposes theirs
  
*LL - Tangentially, the surge in virtual events has also had a positive side effect of expanding access to events that used to be more exclusive. Where conferences and social clubs would have once limited their in person attendance to members only, many of them are now opening them up to the general public. Some even for free. I wonder if they'll continue streaming these events for free once we get back to normal. People would still pay to network in person, so it seems like a positive tactic.* 
  
- A possible upside of the situation is that when you don't have resources, necessity is mother of invention
  - In my experience I find that a lot of entrepreneurs have to hack things together
  - You have limited resources and are trying to cobble something together
  - When you are well resourced at a large company you just call a department to get what you need
  - **Scarcity is a virtue**
  
- The [Santa Fe institute](https://www.santafe.edu/ "Santa Fe") has put out great material on current situation
  - Transmission of virus, biologically, which is independent of what people believe
  - Transmission of information, and there you have both fact and misinformation
  - So you have the speed of biology but also speed of how people are believing things which affects everything
  
- Many different layers all fiercely reacting to each other in this crisis
  - Biology
  - Political
  - Economic
  - Stock Market

*LL - For a framework on how layers interact with each other, check out the [pace layer](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/wisely-and-slow-they-stumble-that "pace") summary I did a while back. It's the idea by Stewart Brand that civilisations consist of multiple layers, each moving at their own speed while interacting with other layers above and below them.*

**Covid predictions**

- Huge disconnect between the real economy and what the market believes
  - When I look at economic destruction that is permanent, particularly for the time it'll take to rebuild for SMBs, I don't think that's fully appreciated
  - Big businesses will be fine
  - We've lost so many jobs so quickly compared to how we created them
  - The ripple effect has been masked by massive federal intervention, buying at the very top of the stack and then all the way down

*LL - I'm having trouble understanding this as well. The bull case is that all of this job loss was priced in, which is why we saw such a large drop. With the Fed giving a backstop to everything, perhaps risk is reduced. Also, if everyone is thinking that things are too good to be true, that implies consensus is cautious already, so we're not at the irrational exuberence stage. The bear case is that this is going to be similar to Jan/Feb, where we all knew covid was happening in China but the market still kept going up*

- The crisis sets up situation where I can see two kinds of companies emerging that dominate:
  - Proxies for 1980's europe, **semi state-owned companies** e.g. Total in France, BP in UK. We could see that writ large
    - Feel we could see a large company becoming a sacrifice here, leading to wave of semi-nationalisation. 
    - These companies could do well with the implicit support, access to cheap capital, government backing 
  - If you continue to see fed support in public markets, you're more likely to see inefficiencies in private markets. There'll be less tourist capital in private markets. People might do **rollups of supply chain, logistics, rebuilding the economy types of businesses**
  - What's underappreciated is the restart of the economy, it's more asymmetric in crashing vs building up

- What do you think would be different had this crisis occurred 10 years in the future?
  - Distributed healthcare
    - A lot of companies experimenting with distributed in person medicine. Things that you wouldn't have to go to a physical center and can get remotely instead. 
    - What is a high end diagnostic tool for imaging now will be more distributed; everyone will have one the way we all have a thermometer now
  - Distribution of logistics
    - More robots and automation will make us more effectively route goods, like how routers route bits.
    - How do you solve the last 100 feet problem, not just the last mile? Every home is different, might still require humans
    - Perhaps something like [Latch](https://www.latch.com/latch-app "Latch") will let you trust people to enter your house and place things
    
*LL - Latch is an app that allows you to unlock doors and share access with others, including generating temporary access codes. Last mile problems in terms of delivering things that very last mile are still a big issue for any company dealing with logistics, due to the cost in providing such a service. Drones have been floated as an alternative to human couriers, though most of those are still in the testing phase and it's uncertain how that would scale in a crowded city.*    

- How do you see this playing out?
  - I see two extremes of locking down vs letting everyone go back to normal 
    - **Both these extremes of complete lockdown and complete back to normal are unlikely**
    - This state we're in (as of Apr 30) is a tolerably intolerable situation for a period of time, but not forever. Perhaps 4 weeks?
  - There will be a **difference between how the dense cities react vs other areas**
    - The greatest economic centers are also the ones most hard hit
    - When you're in a city you get far more of the good during normal times but also more of the bad
    - Scaling of virus effects in dense cities have been painful
    - Between now and Jun 1, using NYC as a proxy, by Jun 1 NYC will be "open" at 30% of normal density. Subways may be different story but on average 30%
    - By Jun 15 there may be reports that NYC is at lower density and that'll induce people to start coming back
    - Then you'll get this pendulum effect of density going up and down, and then NYC will be at 50% density in the fall
    - We'll have preparedness plans in place for fall and it'll be less bad than people think
    - That's the optimistic case, though when I discuss this with Andrew he thinks I'm crazy
    - The difference in how cities vs other areas react will frustrate the people in cities
  - College towns will start to open earlier
    - Will be a difference between have and have nots
    - Will be testing everyone, not having large classes, lockdown on campuses
    - Interesting thing about college towns is that they have cultural vibrancy of cities but without the density concerns
    - Could see migration of older people and retirees around college towns to be around that vibrancy
    - Also see some percentage of colleges disappearing in the next five years
    - There'll be a repurposing of assets that die out, particularly around college towns
    
*LL - That pendulum effect is somewhat similar to what [Tyler Cowen believes](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/04/where-we-stand.html "Tyler"), and how I'm currently thinking as well. Because of the myriad amount of competing concerns, I don't think locking down for extended periods of time will last. We'll get frustrated and loosen up, as is already happening in NYC. Things will get worse and we'll tighten up again. I hope to be proven wrong on this.*

**Predictions**

- **Technological displacement is real in the short term. In the long term it creates all sorts of jobs people can't imagine**
  - No way you'd have imagined web designers, youtubers, vloggers 30 years ago
  - I have no idea what my kids are going to want to do, and no idea what the most important jobs are going to be
  - Facebook, Netflix, etc didn't exist in their current iterations a decade ago 
  
- Individuals have a moral responsibility to learn and level themselves up, and it's never been easier for them to do that

*LL - I'd agree that both the amount of things to learn and the convenience to learn them have increased. However, I'm more skeptical that people will do so. There has always been more than enough material for people to spend the rest of their lives learning, but we always run into other priorities.*

- Technological onshoring will be critical; I'm bullish on it
  - From a security and geopolitical perspective it will become more popular 
  - Will have redundancy, greater distribution, more onshoring
  - **Will sacrifice the efficiency to get more slack in the system**

*LL - People are criticising the lack of slack in the system, usually without realising that it was a direct result of the efficiency that allowed lower prices. Companies are also threatening to move supply chains in response to the crisis. I'm less interested in what people are saying, and more interested in what they actually end up doing. I'd predict many of them make a show of things, and few of them actually do change.*

- Spotlight of the world's attention now is on Covid, and **all the stuff outside of that is going to be important and is what is going to define the rest of the year**
  - The same way how in a heist movie the robbers will do a test to gauge initial response
  - If you're a bad actor you've seen what the first response is and will work around it  

- Three things that I would look at seriously
  - In the face of many emerging markets that are struggling, who's coming in to help them. It's likely **China.**
  - **Africa** will become the next breeding ground, similar to the Middle East, you'll see dissatisfied and unemployed youth. Countries pulling out will create power vacuum
  - **Space** 
  
*LL - I agree that trying to find out what else is happening in the shadow of Covid is important, and am still figuring that out. Africa and Space are areas that have been known trends the past five years at least, and I'm wondering what other areas are currently being underestimated.*

- There's a lot of latent pricing power in some companies e.g. Spectrum, Fios that could have raised prices but didn't due to fear of backlash. 
  - And when they do, that'll result in others coming to provide competing services
  - **I'm bullish on areas that haven't raised pricing and likely will.** When the incumbents do it'll create whitespace for new companies to come in with disruptive situation
  
*LL - Unsure if I entirely understand Josh's last point here. It seems he advocates for investing in startups in areas where the incumbent can raise prices but hasn't, which would be opposite to how Buffett or perhaps a value investor would think. They'd prefer to invest in the incumbent that can take prices up but hasn't needed to yet, since that demonstrates latent customer value.*

- The gap between reality and simulation is shrinking
  - Technologically we're better able to model and measure the world around us with greater resolution
  - The robots and tech that are navigating reality are using models, as we do
  - **The machine does not know the difference between a game simulation that is teaching it to drive and actually driving on the road**
  - All the things that fiction can invoke in you are entirely real, authentic reactions, but they are coming from something fake
  
*LL - This is an interesting point, that since the machine understands the world in terms of however you're programming it, the machine doesn't care if you're feeding it real world data or fake data. It reacts in the same way. Similarly, humans are also programmed to react to stimulus. Whether that is real world data or fake stories, we can still react to it. Sometimes our reactions to fake stories might even be stronger than to real life issues, such as when a movie can make you cry but the news story of a death doesn't. I think the takeaway here is that humans are driven by stories."  

- If you think about finding opportunity between abundance and scarcity
  - In the late 90s everyone was producing blogs and providing information online, the scarce thing was being able to find that needle in the haystack, ergo Google was created
  - Today given the abundance of tools we have in editing where the simulacrum and reality keeps shrinking, the scarce thing is being able to detect veracity
    - **Increasing weight of value will be placed on tools that can detect veracity** in deepfakes, photo edits etc
    - Race between deception and detection

**Being a VC**

- How has your investment thesis involved? Do you have any investments being driven by Covid?
  - We've tracked this, and about 20 out of the 130 or so Lux companies are directly impacted, whether they're 3D printing swabs or scanning physical spaces
  - All of that has been totally unintentional, nothing we're doing purposely for Covid
  - The vast majority of VC will be investing in telepresence space, so I'm not interested in that

- What can you see from the perch of VC that others can't?
  - The cliche thing about VC generally is that the best way to predict the future is to invent it. Those people inventing the future are the scientists and engineers, often inspired by science fiction, that say they want that thing to be real and make it so
  - **Our job is to find these people before others and take an asymmetric view on them;** it's the power of someone who has a secret
  - We go around finding these people and finding out if they're full of shit or not

- VC is a less transactional business than for example retail
  - Game theoretic; I'm only as good as the last deal I did, and have to maintain my long term reputation, which will be compromised if I exploit someone
  - The payback of an investor exploiting someone naive would be pretty swift. e.g. news would travel quickly if a founder got screwed over on terms
  
*LL - I'm less certain on this. There are VC firms that have given tough deals, fired founders, or backed competitors, and they've all still managed to survive so far. If you're able to write large checks regardless of the situation, seems like there'll always be a company that seeks you out. Whether that leads to a positive outcome for all is a separate issue.*  

- How does someone know there's space to break into?
  - I'm psychotically obsessed on competitive advantage
  - Looking at things where nobody else is there
  - **This requires understanding of consensus,** have to understand shared realities and breaking through that shared reality
  - Entrepreneurship is arrogance of the highest order, requires you knowing what everyone else believes, and then having the confidence to say you're going in a different direction
  - That's the status seeking, identity creating thing I think we call creativity
  
*LL - Similar to the principle of [Chesterton's fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence "Fence"), that you shouldn't change something until you understand the reason behind the current state, it's usually worth understanding why your proposed business doesn't yet exist. Sometimes ideas that sound great at first (group coupons, meal kits, DTC) don't work because the market is too small, customer acqusition is too expensive, or the unit economics don't make sense.* 
  
- Being an authentic contrarian vs a consensus contrarian
  - Peter Thiel \[3\] is an example of an authentic contrarian, compared to everyone who says they are contrarian but aren't really
    - However, Thiel also has a measure of what everyone else believes
  - **It's not just the ability to withstand being misunderstood, but also being disliked.** You need to still have comfort in discomfort
  - The most painful feeling is to be socially ostracised, whether that's through technology or other means
    - It's why people trying to leave any sect experience so much pain, spite, tribal exclusion
  - Elements of truth in the [Asch conformity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments 
Asch"), [Milgram Shock](https://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html "Milgram"), [Zimbardo prison](https://www.simplypsychology.org/zimbardo.html "Zimbardo") experiments, though some results are being questioned
    - These experiments show that due to social pressure, many people will feel it's not worth pursuing truth, and would rather have the comfort of being accepeted
    - Having an ally helps. You need to not be the only lunatic
    - If you can get just one person's support it'll lead to great things. 
    - If you're an entrepreneur that hasn't had someone believe in them, and then you get someone that agrees with your vision, that sets a chain reaction off
    
*LL - I've written about the replicability issues with the Stanford prison experiment before [here.](https://www.leonlinsx.com/stanford-prison-replicability/ "stanford") I do agree that people will agree with options that are not optimal due to social pressure. There are also cases such as [the Abilene paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene_paradox "paradox") where the group decides on an action that is counter to the preferences of most of the group. The nuance though is whether people do so for decisions of consequence or not.* 

- **We like to believe before someone else understands** 
    - Need to be careful though, since it's hard to tell at inception of the company between a visionary vs someone trying to defraud you
    - When I meet somebody, I assume "there's daggers behind smiles". Someone smiles and I assume there's an alternative motive. Partially due to how I grew up in Coney Island
     
- When I look for entrepreneurs I look for a common trait, that chip on their shoulder
  - **Chips on shoulders put chips in pockets**
  - Could be that they are a minority, grew up in broken family, or something else
  - There's something they have to prove, an inextinguishable flame that compels them forward regardless of the money or fame they get
  - Often in the face of some adversity they suffered where everyone else was over there and they were ok being the lone person

*LL - Josh might be biased here due to his own tough upbringing. Having something to drive you when all else fails definitely helps with motivation, such as Lincoln, Rowling, or Jim Carrey. There are also plenty of successful people that had an easier start, such as Gates, Bezos, or Zuckerberg.*

**Search for meaning**

- I like the thought experiment of imagining a world where a person existed but the technology didn't e.g. Mozart without the harpsicle, Gates without the PC, Hendrix without the electric guitar
  - **Great artistic expression comes because somebody wants to communicate and finds their medium to do so**
  - There's something broken in you, you don't feel understood
  - You want to find the instrument to express yourself
  
*LL - If you want crazy outcomes you'll likely be dealing with crazy people. There is no line between genius and madness, the only thing that distinguishes them is whether consensus comes around to agree with you. We all admire Newton now, and conveniently forget he spent a good amount of time on alchemy. That made sense for this time, but is a crazy idea in hindsight. I feel that everyone has crazy ideas, and don't execute on most due to fear of social isolation.*
  
- There's something really powerful about exploring the meaning of meaning
  - Thinking about the objects around us, the meaning they might hold for others that is lost on us
   - e.g. a brick on a street might have significance for someone, but we'll walk past it without knowing. 
  - Situations like this happen all the time and we're unaware. There's something really powerful there to explore
   - Stories can inject meaning into an object
  - There's also so many uses of an object. In one case it can be dangerous, in another nobody cares. It's complicated on how the meta labeling of these happens

- **Are we going too quick in some areas?**
  - Many ideas and concepts require context to be understood, and there's nuance in everything
  - Is there a case to be made that we should go slower?
  - I think it's less of a case that people are gullible
  - Instead, people have grown so cynical they don't know who to trust
  
*LL - This goes back to [the pace layer concept](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/wisely-and-slow-they-stumble-that "pace"), which proposes that some systems in civilisation have a certain pace they should move at, and that going faster causes problems.*  
  
- We each have lots of hidden selves, depending on the context
  - The way I am with you vs an entrepreneur vs a board meeting is all different
  - Different power dymanic, expectations
  - Some of these groups don't even know about each other
  - Don't think it's overtly hidden, just not relevant for differnt context
  - I've always thought **the worst terrorist attack would be if we just released everyone's emails and texts for the past year**

**Other**

- There's a tradeoff between liberty and public health in the short term 
  - Even John Stuart Mill did not believe that a sick person under quarantine should have freedom to go out
  - Given there's no antiviral, we have to tradeoff liberty in the short term for benefit of broader society
  - Have to be cautious since some small liberties once given away don't come back, e.g. security screenings post 9-11

- How should we think about welfare and Universal Basic Income (UBI) in the modern world?
  - Media is doing a good job on bringing spotlight on some of worst hit people who do not have resources
  - Disproportionate effect on less well off communities, action is needed to provide a safety net. This is the most urgent social program that needs to be put in place by cities
  - **The big question is how are you going to pay for it?** Maybe some of it is repurposed from Medicare, Social Security
  - Think there's a moral obligation to society to provide basic foundational support to some. Some 80% of people live paycheck to paycheck. 
  - Beyond moral, there's also a logical, purely academic and draconian reason. If you don't provide support now there'll be costs later, whether that's chronic illness, jails, rehabilitation
  - If there was a time politically palatable to try it, it would be now
  - I think it's an experiment worth trying

- Cancel culture is resulting in virtually nil tolerance if someone makes one footfall
  - People that have great contributions to society are being shut down. They are being advised to stay low, out of limelight
  - Comedians are an entire class of people we pay to reveal uncomfortable truths.
    - The social scientists of human nature
    - Given permission to say the things people might be thinking but are afraid to say
    - Comedians reveal great truths. Probably so many of them depressed because they see truth and are burdened by the truths they see
  - It's also an interesting phenomenon on figuring out what is the shared collective temperature and who gets to set that   

*LL - Can you separate the idea from the person? Should you? Given the crazy genius hypothesis above, should we expect unpalatable statements from our idols every now and then? I try to evaluate ideas on their own merit, but it's impossible to do without bias.*

- The most persuasive argument I've heard about consciousness comes from [Jeff Hawkins](https://loupventures.com/002-jeff-hawkins/ "Jeff") and it is about memory prediction
  - If you see my shoes, you'll associate that with me. If you see my shoes and then see someone else, you'll get an emotional surprise. That adjusts the mental model you have, so you have an updating model of reality
  - How this model of reality we hold interacts with the real world and is getting continuous feedback
  - Where technology is trending is where the line between model and reality is thinning

- I'm not in the [Nick Bostrom](https://samharris.org/ "Nick") or [Sam Harris](https://samharris.org/ "Sam") camp for artificial general intelligence. I'm more in [David Deutsch's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch "David") camp
  - Bostrom, along with other very smart people, is concerned about us becoming paper clip factories and being harvested by sentient machines that have run amok
    - We're approaching high accuracy in being able to construct text from machines that would fool most people, beat humans at games etc
  - Deutsch makes the argument that the more dangerous thing is not AI run amok but the average teenager
    - Inside a simulation, the simulation can have all the tools that you give it, but it won't have tools that are outside the simulation and it can't create tools outside of the system
    - Even when AI can create something that would pass a Turing Test and be able to fool most people into thinking it was created by a human, it's still constrained by the system
    - If you accept the premise that the AI is within a simulation, they can't come out of the simulation's constraints
    
*LL - This might be a reference to [Godel's incompleteness theorem,](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-godels-theorem/ "Godel") which states that within a complete system, there are statements that are unprovable using the inherent logic of the system itself \[4\]. Josh is making the argument that AI will be limited in scope to whatever system it is running in. Because we control the systems a layer of reality above the AI, AI will not be able to have more power than we do.*

2. Eric's podcast included a good amount of him talking as well. For purposes of this post I'll be excluding them. He has a segment at the start where he talks about how idealism is a cover story for wealth or power transfers e.g. feminism for companies to get more labour, free access to information for companies to gather data moats, patriotism to dilute the power of labour. It's an interesting theory, and I think it's hard to separate people who are genuine believers of the cause vs people who are trying to exploit the cause.
