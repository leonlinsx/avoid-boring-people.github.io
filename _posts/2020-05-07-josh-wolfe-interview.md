**Main**

[Josh Wolfe](https://luxcapital.com/team/josh-wolfe/ "Josh") is a VC at Lux Capital, which invests in early-stage ventures that are solving hard tech problems of the future, such as [drone sentry security systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmI4Bwks2bg "Anduril") \[1\]. He was recently interviewed by Michael Milstein, founder of [Company,](https://www.company.co/about-us/ "Company") a curated community of NYC startups and entreprenuers. The video link is [here](https://vimeo.com/414116322 "link"), and notes below cover:

 **Current situation**

- The hardest thing for most people to deal with now is the kids 
  - It's easier for us as adults to adjust but harder for them when missing out on the social aspect of school
  - As most of us have come to realise, teaching is underappreciated 
    - It's not just hard to do at an individual and classroom level
    - But it's also a form of daycare
  - If you recall that funny [BBC interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4f9AYRCZY "bbc") of the kids walking in on a parent, we were all laughing because it was absurd
    - Now, absurd has become the normal
    
- Positive side of this is that it's allowed us to be more together
  - People are contributing to teach each other, communities forming
  - For example, our households are doing debates with people taking the view that opposes theirs
  
- When you don't have resources, necessity is mother of invention
  - In my experience I find that a lot of entrepreneurs have to hack things together
  - You have limited resources and are trying to cobble something together
  - When you are well resourced at a large company you just call a department to get what you need
  - Scarcity is a virture
  
- [Santa Fe institute](https://www.santafe.edu/ "Santa Fe") has put out great material on current situation
  - Transmission of virus, biologically, which is independent of what people believe
  - Transmission of information, and there you have both fact and misinformation
  - So you have the speed of biology but also speed of how people are believing things which affects everything
  
- Many different layers all fiercely reacting to each other in this crisis
  - Biology
  - Political
  - Economic
  - Stock Market

*LL - For a framework on how layers interact with each other, check out the [pace layer](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/wisely-and-slow-they-stumble-that "pace") summary I did a while back. Civilisations consist of multiple layers, each moving at their own speed and interacting with other layers above and below them.*

**Effect on businesses**

- Huge disconnect between the real economy and what the market believes
  - When I look at economic destruction that is permanent, particularly for the time it'll take to rebuild for SMBs, don't think that's fully appreciated
  - Big businesses will be fine
  - We've lost so many jobs so quickly compared to how we created them
  - The ripple effect has been masked by massive federal intervention, buying at the very top of the stack and then all the way down

*LL - I'm having trouble understanding this as well. The bull case is that all of this job loss was priced in, which is why we saw such a large drop. Also, if everyone is thinking that things are unsafe, that implies consensus is cautious. The bear case is that this is going to be similar to Jan/Feb, where we all knew covid was happening in China but the market still kept going up*

- Sets up situation where I can see two kinds of companies emerging that dominate:
  - Proxies for 1980's europe, **semi state-owned companies** e.g. Total in France, BP in UK. We could see that writ large
    - Feel we could see a large company becoming a sacrifice here, leading to wave of semi-nationalisation. 
    - These companies could do well with the implicit support, access to cheap capital, government backing 
  - If you continue to see fed support in public markets, you're more likely to see inefficiencies in private markets. There'll be less tourist capital in private markets. People might do **rollups of supply chain, logistics, rebuilding the economy types of businesses**
  - What's underappreciated is the restart of the economy, it's more asymmetric in crashing vs building up

- What do you think would be different had this crisis occurred 10 years in the future?
  - Distributed healthcare
    - A lot of companies experimenting with distributed in person medicine. Things that you wouldn't have to go to a physical center and can get remotely instead. 
    - What is a high end diagnostic tool for imaging now will be more distributed; everyone will have one the way we have a thermometer
  - Distribution of logistics
    - More robots and automation will make us more effectively route goods, like how routers route bits.
    - How do you solve the last 100 feet problem, not just the last mile. Every home is different, might still require humans
    - Perhaps something like [Latch](https://www.latch.com/latch-app "Latch") will let you trust people to enter your house and place things
    
*LL - Latch is an app that allows you to unlock doors and share access with others, including generating temporary access codes. Last mile problems in terms of delivering things that very last mile are still a big issue for any company dealing with logistics, due to the cost in providing such a service. Drones have been floated as an alternative to human couriers, though most of those are still in the testing phase and it's uncertain how that would scale in a crowded city.*    
    
**Predictions**

- How do you see this playing out?
  - I see two extremes of locking down vs letting everyone go back to normal. 
    - **Both these extremes of complete lockdown and complete back to normal are unlikely**
    - This state we're in (as of Apr 30) is a tolerably intolerable situation for a period of time, but not forever. Perhaps 4 weeks?
  - There will be a **difference between how the dense cities react vs other areas**
    - The greatest economic centers are also the ones most hard hit
    - When you're in a city you get far more of the good during normal times but also more of the bad
    - Scaling of virus effects in dense cities have been painful
    - Between now and Jun 1, using NYC as a proxy, by Jun 1 NYC will be "open" at 30% of normal density. Subways may be different story but on average 30%
    - By Jun 15 there may be reports that NYC is at lower density and that'll induce people to start coming back
    - Then you'll get this pendulum effect of density going up and down, and then NYC will be at 50% density in the fall
    - We'll have preparedness plans in place for fall and it'll be less bad than people think
    - That's the optimistic case, though when I discuss this with Andrew he thinks I'm crazy
    - The difference in how cities vs other areas react will frustrate the people in cities
  - College towns will start to open earlier
    - Will be a difference between have and have nots
    - Will be testing everyone, not having large classes, lockdown on campuses
    - Interesting thing about college towns is they have cultural vibrancy of cities but without the density concerns
    - Could see migration of older people and retirees around college towns to be around that vibrancy
    - Also see some percentage of colleges disappearing in the next five years
    - Repurposing of assets that die out, particularly around college towns
    
*LL - That pendulum effect is somewhat similar to what [Tyler Cowen believes](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/04/where-we-stand.html "Tyler"), and how I'm currently thinking as well. Because of the myriad amount of competing concerns, I don't think locking down for extended periods of time will last. We'll get frustrated and loosen up, as is already happening in NYC. Things will get worse and we'll tighten up again. I hope to be proven wrong on this.*
    
- **Technological displacement is real in the short term. In the long term it creates all sorts of jobs people can't imagine**
  - No way you'd have imagined web designers, youtubers, vloggers 30 years ago
  - I have no idea what my kids are going to want to do, and no idea what the most important jobs are going to be
  - Facebook, Netflix, etc didn't exist in their current iterations a decade ago
  
- Individuals have a moral responsibility to learn and level themselves up, and it's never been easier for them to do that

- Technological onshoring will be critical, I'm bullish on it
  - From security and geopolitical perspective will be more popular 
  - Will have redundancy, greater distribution, more onshoring
  - Should sacrifice the efficienty to get more slack in the system

- How has your investment thesis involved? Do you have any investments being driven by Covid?
  - We've tracked this, and about 20 out of the 130 or so Lux companies are directly impacted, whether they're 3D printing swabs or scanning physical spaces
  - All of that has been totally unintentional, nothing we're doing purposely for Covid
  - Believe vast majority of VC will be investing in telepresence spacce so I'm not interested in that

- Spotlight of the world's attention now is on Covid, and **all the stuff outside of that is going to be important and is what is going to define the rest of the year**
  - The same way how in a heist movie the robbers will do a test to gauge initial response
  - If you're a bad actor you've seen what the first response is and will work around it  

- Three things that I would look at seriously
  - In the face of many emerging markets that are struggling, who's coming in to help them. Likely China.
  - Africa will become the next breeding ground, similar to the Middle East, you'll see dissatisfied and unemployed youth. Countries pulling out will create power vacuum
  - Space 
  
*LL - I agree that trying to find out what else is happening in the shadow of Covid is important, and am still figuring that out. Africa and Space are areas that have been known trends the past five years at least, and I'm wondering what other areas are currently being underestimated.*

**VC**

- VC is a less transactional business 
  - Game theoretic, I'm only as good as the last deal I did, and have to maintain my long term reputation, which will be compromised if I exploit someone
  - The payback of an investor exploiting someone naive would be pretty swift. e.g. news would travel quickly if a founder got screwed over on terms

- How does someone know there's space to break into?
  - I'm psychotically obsessed on competitive advantage
  - Looking at things where nobody else is there
  - This requires understanding of consensus, have to understand shared realities and breaking through that shared reality
  - Entrepreneurship is arrogance of the highest order, requires you knowing what everyone else believes and then having the confidence to say you're going in a different direction
  - That's the status seeking, identity creating thing I think we call creativity
  
- Being an authentic contrarian vs a consensus contrarian
  - Peter Thiel is an example of an authentic contrarian, compared to everyone who says they are contrarian but aren't really. However, Thiel also has a measure of what everyone else believes
  - Not just the ability to withstand being misunderstood, but also being disliked. Comfort in discomfort
  - The most painful feeling is to be socially ostracised, whether that's through technology or other means.
    - It's why people trying to leave any sect or tribe experience so much pain
  - Elements of truth in the [Asch conformity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments 
Asch"), [Milgram Shock](https://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html "Milgram"), [Zimbardo prison](https://www.simplypsychology.org/zimbardo.html "Zimbardo") experiments, though some results are being questioned
    - These show that due to social pressure, many people will feel it's not worth pursuing truth, and would rather have the comfort of being accepeted
    - Having an ally helps. If you can get just one person's support it'll lead to great things. If you're an entrepreneur that hasn't had someone believe in them, and then you get someone that agrees with your vision, that sets a chain reaction off

- We like to believe before someone else understands. 
    - Need to be careful though since it's hard to tell at inception of the company between a visionary vs someone trying to defraud you
    - When I meet somebody, I assume "there's daggers behind smiles". Someone smiles and I assume there's an alternative motive. Partially due to how I grew up in Coney Island
     
- When I look for entrepreneurs I look for a common trait, that chip on their shoulder
  - Chips on shoulders put chips in pockets
  - There's something they have to prove, inextinguishable flame that compels them forward
  - Often in the face of some adversity they suffered
 

**Other**

- There's a tradeoff between liberty and public health in the short term 
  - Even John Stuart Mill did not believe that a sick person under quarantine should have freedom to go out
  - Given there's no antiviral, we have to tradeoff liberty in the short term for benefit of broader society
  - Have to be cautious since some small liberties once given away don't come back, e.g. security screenings post 9-11

- How should we think about welfare and Universal Basic Income (UBI) in the modern world?
  - Media is doing a good job on bringing spotlight on some of worst hit people who do not have resources
  - Disproportionate effect on less well off communities, action is needed to provide a safety net. This is the most urgent social program that needs to be put in place by cities
  - **The big question is how are you going to pay for it?** Maybe some of it is repurposed from Medicare, Social Security
  - Think there's a moral obligation to society to provide basic foundational support to some. Some 80% of people live paycheck to paycheck. 
  - Beyond moral, there's also a logical, purely academic and draconian reason. If you don't provide support now there'll be costs later, whether that's chronic illness, jails, rehabilitation
  - If there was a time politically palatable to try it, it would be now
  - I think it's an experiment worth trying

- There's a lot of latent pricing power in some companies e.g. Spectrum, Fios that could have raised prices but didn't due to fear of backlash. 
  - And when they do, that'll result in others coming to provide competing services
  - I'm bullish on areas that haven't raised pricing and likely will. When the incumbents do it'll create whitespace for new companies to come in with disruptive situation
  
*LL - Unsure if I entirely understand Josh's last point here. It seemed he advocates for investing in areas where the incumbent can raise prices but hasn't, which would be opposite to how Buffett or perhaps a value investor would think. They'd prefer to invest in the incumbent that can take prices up but hasn't needed to yet.*

- Cancel culture is resulting in virtually nil tolerance if someone makes one footfall
  - People that have great contributions to society are being advised to stay low, out of limelight
  - Comedians are an entire class of people we pay to reveal uncomfortable truths.
    - The social scientists of human nature
    - Given permission to say the things people might be thinking but are afraid to say
    - Comedians reveal great truths. Probably so many of them depressed because they see truth and are burdened
  - It's also an interesting phenomenon on figuring out what is the shared collective temperature and who gets to set that
  
- I like the thought experiment of imagining a world where a person existed but the technology didn't e.g. Mozart without the harpsicle, Gates without the PC, Hendrix without the electric guitar
  - Great artistic expression comes because somebody wants to communicate and finds their medium to do so
  - There's something broken in you, you don't feel understood, and you find the instrument to express yourself
  
- There's something really powerful about exploring the meaning of meaning
  - Thinking about the objects around us, the meaning they might hold for others that is lost on us
    - e.g. a brick on a street might have significance for someone, but we'll walk past it without knowing. 
    - Situations like this happen all the time and we're unaware
  -
