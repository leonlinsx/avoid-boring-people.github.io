## Main

We've [talked about lotteries before](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/it-only-goes-up-from-here "lottery"), where we saw how poor people buying lottery tickets may not be as "dumb" a decision as commonly perceived. When $2 can either buy you a bagel or a chance to change your life, you might choose the latter.

I don't have anything against lotteries - they're a [regressive tax](https://www.thebalance.com/regressive-tax-definition-history-effective-rate-4155620 "tax"), but restricting them would lead to illegal alternatives anyway. **People are going to gamble.** 

And by people I don't mean some nebulous, imaginary other. I mean **you and me.** We'll see opportunities that seem too good to be true (hint: they are), and be tempted to take part. We might even join in.

**And that's ok.** Again, people are going to gamble, and if you didn't put your money in some [Fyre festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyre_Festival "fyre") timeshare you'd have put it in a penny stock anyway. 

Rather than resisting temptation forever (unlikely), a better approach is to prepare for the behavioural challenges that are likely to occur. A lot of the common financial knowledge is good advice (diversify, low cost investments etc), but we often fail to account for the fact that people want an outlet to gamble. This ends up backfiring when people can't resist any longer and take on too much risk in a moment of weakness.

This is not investment advice, and I think having a small % of your overall portfolio set aside for wild bets can help. For example, dedicate a maximum of 5% of your capital to gamble with, knowing full well you could lose all of it. You'll be able to satisfy both the gambling urge whenever it arises, but never be in a position to risk your livelihood. It's not the financially optimal solution, but a behaviourally focused one.

As John Huber likes to write, we can think of financial returns coming from [three main sources:](https://sabercapitalmgt.com/what-is-your-edge/ "edge")

1. Information advantage - you have more/better information
2. Analytical advantage - your analysis of that information is better
3. Behavioural advantage - your mindset and actions

I believe that the information and analytical advantages continue to shrink in the financial markets, and are already not very large for the pros. I also believe that the behavioural advantage is not shrinking, and will continue to be a differentiator for financial returns.

Some other ways to take advantage 

long term vs short term

doing nothing vs doing something

boring vs exciting

simple vs complicated
