## Behavioural edge and why it's difficult

John Huber likes to divide the "edge" you can get in investing into [three main sources:](https://sabercapitalmgt.com/what-is-your-edge/ "edge")

1. Information advantage - you have more/better information
2. Analytical advantage - your analysis of that information is better
3. Behavioural advantage - your mindset and actions

I believe that information and analytical advantages continue to shrink, and are already not very large, even for the pros. Remember that it is the [relative difference](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/relatively-speaking-the-billionaire "relative") that matters, and not the absolute level. If you're using satellite data and your competitor is too, you do not have an information edge. If your detailed diligence process is the same as that of another [Tiger cub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Management "Tiger") because your bosses used to work together, you do not have an analytical edge.  

I also believe that the behavioural advantage is not shrinking, and will continue to be a differentiator for financial returns. The speed of information transfer has changed, analytical methods are well known, but humans still behave the same.

Some examples of behavioural edge:

**Short term vs long term.** If you'd put $100 in the S&P 500 in 1990, you'd have 10x your money this year. That sounds like a big number. 

On average though, you'd have earned ~8% a year. That sounds like a small number.

That difference in "feeling" there is why people can earn the big number. You get paid for patience.

**Doing nothing vs doing something.** Professional money managers are incentivised to turnover their portfolio, since they themselves have clients to cater to. Imagine the following meeting:

> Client - "So, what's new in the portfolio?"

> Investor - "Nothing, we're still in the book store we mentioned."

> Client - "Wasn't that the same stock from last year?"

> Investor - "Yep, and the same one from four years ago. We haven't actually done anything."

> Client - "What am I paying you for then?"

That's why we see stocks like Amazon >100x in our lifetime, and don't see active managers do the same. If everyone else *has* to make trades to keep their job, doing nothing might actually give you an edge.

**Boring vs exciting.** Why are the above behaviours difficult? Because they're *boring*. We like activity and hate staying still. It's hard to brag at a cocktail party that your gains are small, slow, and simple. Just like how ["sin stocks" need to have higher expected excess returns](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/Virtue-is-its-Own-Reward-Or-One-Mans-Ceiling-is-Another-Mans-Floor "asness"), "boredom" stock behaviours also give you an edge.

Having said all the above, am I really expecting anyone to follow the plan exactly? Should we just buy the S&P and go to sleep? 

Nah, not really. Lord, make me chaste - but not yet. It's a great plan, but too difficult for most people to follow. Keeping in mind that this is not investment advice, let's add a small tweak to the portfolio:

One big reason people fail to follow such a plan is that we all like gambling. We'll see opportunities that seem too good to be true (hint: they are), and are tempted to join in. I do that all the time, despite knowing all the above.

Knowing that's the case, **having a small percentage of the portfolio dedicated for wild bets** seems like a reasonable compromise for our own fallible behaviour. Rather than resisting temptation forever (unlikely), a better approach is to prepare for the behavioural challenges that are likely to occur. 

A lot of the common financial knowledge is good advice (diversify, low cost investments etc), but we often fail to account for the fact that people want an outlet to gamble. This ends up backfiring when people can't resist any longer and take on too much risk in a moment of weakness.

Instead, say you set aside 5% of your capital to invest in [Fyre festival time shares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyre_Festival "fyre") and the latest pump and dump scheme. You'll be able to satisfy both the gambling urge whenever it arises, but never be in a position to risk your livelihood. If you lose all the 5%, that's too bad, but you've capped your downside. And if you've stumbled upon the next Amazon, that's fantastic.

**The best investment plan is the one that you can actually stick with.** It may not be the financially optimal solution, but is a behaviourally focused one.
