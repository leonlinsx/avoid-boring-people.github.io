        padding-top: 50%; <!-- Calculated from the aspect ration of the content (in case of 16:9 it is 9/16= 0.5625) -->
        position: relative;
      }
      .iframe-container iframe { 
         border: 0;
         height: 100%; <!-- Finally, width and height are set to 100% so the iframe takes up 100% of the containers space. -->

Back when I was leaving investment banking I wanted to reflect on what I'd learnt. Partially because of that, I put together a list of topics that I thought a junior banker should aim to be familiar with during their time there. The list is neither meant to be comprehensive, nor do I think you can be an expert at all the areas after just a few years. Admittedly I've already forgotten some of the areas below. However, I still believe it is helpful for reference. The list is below:
