\* *Note: this is a backdated post from a framework I used in the past, edited for brevity*

Back when I was leaving investment banking I wanted to reflect on what I'd learnt. Partially because of that, I put together a list of topics that I thought a junior banker should aim to be familiar with during their time there. The list is neither meant to be comprehensive, nor do I think you can be an expert at all the areas after just a few years. Admittedly I've already forgotten some of the areas below. However, I still believe it is helpful for reference. The list is below:
