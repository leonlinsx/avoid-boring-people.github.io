## 1.

I want to talk about [Plaid](https://plaid.com/ "plaid") today, and it'll help to get some intuition behind abstraction and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) before that. I'll try a few ways of explaining the concepts to help them stick, erring on the side of being less technically accurate for easier understanding.

Suppose you have an idea to make lots of money with a groundbreaking app. You code your app such that every time a person presses the F2 key on their keyboard, stuff happens and they make a profit:

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/plaid_api/plaid_1.png)

You test this on your personal laptop, all works well, and you start raking in cash. It works so well that you tell all your friends about it, and they want in on it too. You send them the code and tell them to go forth and prosper. 

One of your friends (the annoying hipster one) tells you that the code doesn't work on his Mac, and he's sad he can't make money for his next single origin single barrel single plant cup of coffee. You wonder why, and go troubleshoot the code.

Turns out Macs have this weird [Touch Bar thing](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlbfd5b039/mac "touch") for function keys, whose sole purpose as far as you can tell seems to be to make life miserable. You add in support for Macs in your code with a special case for Mac users:

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/plaid_api/plaid_2.png)

It works for him now, and he moves on to his next task of [suing a magazine for saying all hipsters look alike.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/hipster-magazine-photo-lawsuit-mit-technology-review-a8813941.html "hipster")

Another friend asks if you can also support mobile phones, so you can make money on the go. Someone else asks if you can add Blackberry support. And yet another wants to know when the app will be available for the [KFC gaming console](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55433318 "kfc"). 

As you stare at these tasks of adding more code for all the different computing devices out there, you start to despair. Why can't making money be as easy as pushing a button? You just want to write your code once, and then be able to use it across multiple devices.

The idea above is actually a common problem in computing (multiple device support, not the money making one). If you write software that is meant to do everything, you'll need to account for many possible end user devices. If your code is supposed to go all the way down to binary language (1s and 0s) for computers to run, and every computer has different ways of running, you'll spend more time worrying about adding code to support grandma's Windows 95 than actually adding new features.

In the late 90s people realised a solution to this was to add an additional layer in between, aka make it someone else's problem. [As Shimon Schocken explains,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E28KczysecE "Shimon") having a "middleman" now simplifies your task. Instead of writing code for every possible device, you "write once, run anywhere", and let that middleman deal with making your code compatible with anything \[1\]:

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/plaid_api/plaid_3.png)

Splitting up the one big task into smaller tasks makes it easier for everyone. Having that layer of abstraction in between allows you to write code and not worry about specific implementation. Other people may actually like the details of implementation, but don't want to code the apps on top of it. From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs and all that jazz.

We'll come back to this idea of abstraction, which lets people focus on just specific portions of a task.

Now, suppose you and your friends want to put all of that money into banks around the world for safekeeping. The banks all have different procedures, and will kick you out if you don't follow their rules:
- The New York location just wants you to say your account number, password, and order, [banning you if you talk too much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euLQOQNVzgY "soup")
- The San Francisco location won't serve you unless you display at least 5 company stickers on your laptop
- The Singapore location wants to know when you're expecting to get married and have children for the sake of the country

Most of you in the group hate memorising all these rules, but April is an exception. She delights in handling esoteric options, and volunteers to deal with all the banks on behalf of the group. Not caring about how your money is deposited and withdrawn, but only that it does get done, the group agrees to let her deal with everything.

You're talking with some acquaintances, and mention this bizarre arrangement you have. They're intrigued, as they also dislike dealing directly with their banks. They want to know if April would be willing to help them out too. She's happy to do so as long as they pay her a small fee for her time. Word spreads, and pretty soon everyone is using April as an intermediary.

We see again that people cared most about one part of a larger task, and were fine with however it got done behind the scenes. Having April around made life easier.

Lastly, suppose you wanted to double check your account balance, just to make sure April isn't embezzling the money to pay for hidden service fees in the AirBNB she's renting. You pull up your spreadsheet program of choice, and start typing in the recent deposits:

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/plaid_api/plaid_4.png)

Being a programmer, you scorn excel and aren't familiar with its features. You're pretty sure you can use the "+" sign to add things up though, and start manually calculating your balance that way:

A hundred cells and an hour later, you're close to being done, when a friend asks you what you're doing.

1. To be more technically accurate, it would be the compiler that has to be compatible with every device, and not the code itself, which is a layer above the compiler.
