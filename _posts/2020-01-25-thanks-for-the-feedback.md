Many points will be outright quotes from the book. 

- There are three different feedback triggers that provoke a response in us
  - Truth triggers are set off by the sunstance of the feedback; it feels unhelpful or just wrong
  - Relationship triggers are set off by the person giving us feedback, based on how we perceive the person and how we're feeling treated
  - Identity triggers are set off by something causing us to feel threatened about our identity
  - This is all reasonable. Our triggered reactions are not obstacles because they are unreasonable, but because they prevent us from engaging in the conversatoin
- Feedback comes in three different kinds
  - Appreciation and thanks
  - Coaching you on a better way to do the task
  - Evaluation of where you stand \[1\]
  - We need all three, but often get a different type vs what we want
- Feedback often arrives in the form of a label e.g. Be more confident
  - This causes a difference between what was meant vs what was heard e.g. have the confidence to say you don't know vs give the impression you know things even when you don't
  - In order to reduce this difference, figure out where your feedback is 1) coming from, based on data and their interpretation, and 2) where your feedback is going, what they expect 
  - Ask what's different about 1) the data and 2) the interpretations of it
- There is a gap between our self-perception and how others perceive us. This is affected by
  - We discount our emotions in the moment, but that's what others see and think of us e.g. if we get angry at a suggestion one time
  - We attribute things to the situation, but others attribute it to our character
  - We judge ourselves by our intentions, but others judge us on the outcome
- Conversations can get 'switchtracked', when the person receiving the feedback is triggered and switches topics
  - The potential positive impact is that the other topic could be important as well
  - The negative impact is the tangling of two topics, made worse by us not realising there are two topics
  - When you realise there are two topics running at the same time, call it out explicitly and propose a way forward e.g. I see two related but separate topics, let's discuss each fully but separately
- Look at the feedback from a bigger picture point of view
  - Are differences between you and me causing issues?
  - Are the different roles causing issues?
  - Are processes, policies, or something else causing issues?
- Take responsibility for your part, but don't go to an extreme in denying all responsibility or taking all the blame
- How you react to feedback depends on three things
  - Your baseline state of happiness and satisfaction e.g. ppl with higher happiness baselines respond more positively to positive feedback than ppl with lower baselines
  - How far you swing from your baseline when you get feedback e.g. more swing means more sensitivity to negative feedback
  - How long it takes for you to return to baseline 
- Some ways to be better prepared for feedback are:
  - Be prepared for feedback you're expecting, and check in on yourself and slow things down when you're getting it
  - Separate your feelings in the moment vs the story you're telling about yourself vs the actual feedback
  - Contain the feedback to what it is about, and understand what it isn't about
  - Change your point of view to that of others, the future, or more humourous
  - Accept that you can't control how others view you \[2\]
- We can't control feedback we get, but can improve how we receive it by:
  - Moving away from simple labels and towards accepting complexity
  - Moving away from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset
- We have to accept three things about ourselves:
  - We will make mistakes
  - We have complex intentions
  - We have contributed to the problem
- Give yourself a second score based on how well you handle the first score/feedback that you got
- Having boundaries and being able to turn down feedback is crucial to healthy relationships. These include:
  - Saying thanks and no e.g. happy to hear it, might not take it
  - Saying not now e.g. this is too sensitive at the moment
  - Saying no feedback at all 
- If you can't change, work to reduce the impact on others
  - Ask about how it affects them
  - Coach them to deal with the unchanged you
  - Try to problem solve as a team

  

**Footnotes**
1. All coaching includes some evaluation as well, and can often be misunderstood
2. Don't accept everything that they say outright. Take their opinion as one input of a whole
