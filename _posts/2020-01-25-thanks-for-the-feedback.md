Many points will be outright quotes from the book. 

- There are three different feedback triggers that provoke a response in us
  - Truth triggers are set off by the sunstance of the feedback; it feels unhelpful or just wrong
  - Relationship triggers are set off by the person giving us feedback, based on how we perceive the person and how we're feeling treated
  - Identity triggers are set off by something causing us to feel threatened about our identity
  - This is all reasonable. Our triggered reactions are not obstacles because they are unreasonable, but because they prevent us from engaging in the conversatoin
- Feedback comes in three different kinds
  - Appreciation and thanks
  - Coaching you on a better way to do the task
  - Evaluation of where you stand \[1\]
  - We need all three, but often get a different type vs what we want
- Feedback often arrives in the form of a label e.g. Be more confident
  - This causes a difference between what was meant vs what was heard e.g. have the confidence to say you don't know vs give the impression you know things even when you don't
  - In order to reduce this difference, figure out where your feedback is 1) coming from, based on data and their interpretation, and 2) where your feedback is going, what they expect 
  - Ask what's different about 1) the data and 2) the interpretations of it
- There is a gap between our self-perception and how others perceive us. This is affected by
  - We discount our emotions in the moment, but that's what others see and think of us e.g. if we get angry at a suggestion one time
  - We attribute things to the situation, but others attribute it to our character
  - We judge ourselves by our intentions, but others judge us on the outcome
- Conversations can get 'switchtracked', when the person receiving the feedback is triggered and switches topics
  - The potential positive impact is that the other topic could be important as well
  - The negative impact is the tangling of two topics, made worse by us not realising there are two topics
  - When you realise there are two topics running at the same time, call it out explicitly and propose a way forward e.g. I see two related but separate topics, let's discuss each fully but separately
- Look at the feedback from a bigger picture point of view
  - Are differences between you and me causing issues?
  - Are the different roles causing issues?
  - Are processes, policies, or something else causing issues?
- Take responsibility for your part, but don't go to an extreme in denying all responsibility or taking all the blame 

**Footnotes**
1. All coaching includes some evaluation as well, and can often be misunderstood
