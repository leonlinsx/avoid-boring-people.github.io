**Main**

I've summarised talks by [Operator Collective](https://operatorcollective.com/about/ "Op Co") \[1\] from [COOs](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/how-to-get-back-to-better "coo") and CMOs recently, and will be doing another summary today [for a talk they did with CFOs on enterprise spending.](https://vimeo.com/417796182 "event") 

Their talk involved Elena Gomez, Zendesk CFO and Kelly Steckelberg, Zoom CFO \[2\]. Notes below will sometimes be paraphrased for clarity, and cover the following topics:

1. 

Highlights for me were:
- 

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Opco marketing.png)

**1st**

**What challenges are your companies facing?**

Elena 
- Just like a lot of other companies, really focusing on the customer, helping them navigate volatility
- Also focused on employee safety, trying to be as agile as we can
- Focused on prioritisation more than we'd typically be at this point in the year

Kelly
- While our daily participants have 30x, our staff did not
- Biggest challenge has been scaling our ability to support the customer, and that started with bandwidth
- Also making sure we take care of employees with their needs in the pandemic

**Any tips for making daily standups more effective?**

Elena
- Making sure it's not a prescribed agenda but more fluid, top of mind, oriented to employees and customers
- More casual, informal. More important to have the discussion than the 20 page deck

Kelly
- We also do ours quickly, so everyone is focused 

**How are you changing your spending?**

Elena
- Not immediately a budget cut, but a look across the company investments and which we want to preserve for growth
- Preserve engineering capacity, sales quota capacity as a starting point since without those you can't grow
- Then we look at the supporting functions, and it isn't an immediate "Let's just cut G&A" because that's too blunt of a cut. Where do we have G&A investments that support growth? 
- Relax hiring to a degree where we can absorb it more

Kelly
- Found that we had to adjust our annual budget on almost a monthly basis post covid. We're doing monthly reviews of spending and looking at asks that are coming up
- Some obvious things like travel, events, we're looking at redeploying those budgets
- Looking at things on a short term cadence since we can't look at an annual or even quarterly budget anymore
- Sales org, anything that relates to supporting our customers, we want to ensure they still have capacity

**What metrics do you look at?**

Kelly
- How are people using zoom and what do we mean to them?
- Looking at retention metrics diffrently and more detailed than before e.g. by cohort, segment, usage trends
- Watching your receivables and making sure that you're thoughtful if customers have problems paying

Elena
- Paying attention to usage of our product as a leading indicator
- Would have looked at these monthly, but now are looking at weekly or even daily
- Looking at pipeline

**What metrics should companies be looking at given longer term effect on customer cohorts?**

Elena
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) will always be important to us
- Looking at renewal rates since easier to preserve customer than get new one. By country, region, over period of time
- Most important thing that drives your revenue as a SaaS company is your current book of business
- What's changed rather than the type of metric is how often we look at the metrics

Kelly
- Your core fundamental metrics should still be in place. Don't throw them out even though they might look differently historically
- Base of business might have changed, but you'll still have to keep eye on fundamentals

**What are you looking at the metrics for? To guide spend, business exploration, other?**

Kelly
- Guidance in terms of trends to ensure we have right capacity to support customer, resources and people in place to get to a P&L forecast

Elena
- How can I make sure I support customers and employees in a way they'd feel proud of how we're navigating this time

**What spend guidance do you have for your company?**

Elena
- It has to have a long term impact, either to help us scale or drive revenue
- Also looking at what tools we'll need to support our teams with continued work from home?
- Any new spend is coming to me, and I'm saying no to some new contracts that in a different world I'd have said yes to

Kelly
- Thinking about the short term and long term needs
- Want to make sure we aren't overreacting in the short term and that our investments have long term ROI

**How are you thinking about sales comp?**

Elena
- Evaluating different types of quota adjustments if we need to
- We're leveraging [SPIFFs](https://incentiveinsights.com/blog/a-spiff-and-spiv/ "spiff") as much as we can

Kelly
- Reserved comment given they were in [quiet period for company earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quietperiod.asp "quiet")

**What shape of recession do you think we're in?**

Elena
- My view is we're in an L, and that could change next week
- In early innings of longer recovery.

Kelly
- Don't know how to predict what stage we're in, but think we're in early stages
- Think it's going to get worse before it gets better

**What has been helpful in getting contract over the line?**

Elena
- Looking for customers that are in industries that have been in distress and then trying to work with them
- Everyone's different. Some are more cash oriented, some more operating expense, some looking for a short term fix
- Understand what the customer is trying to solve for

Kelly
- Providing increased level of flexibility in both buying process and existing customers

**How are you thinking about returning to office?**

 Elena
 - Top of mind for many CFOs I'm talking to
 - Thinking about how aggressive we could be on working from home, and what tools we'd need for that e.g. zoom, slack
 - What does our end state look like, and what does our interim state look like
  
 Kelly
 - Want our employees to feel safe and supported regardless of how comfortable they feel about returning to the office
 - We've set an internal target but will re-evaluate
 
 **What does the world of M&A look like?**
 
 Kelly
 - [Keybase acquisition](https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/05/07/zoom-acquires-keybase-and-announces-goal-of-developing-the-most-broadly-used-enterprise-end-to-end-encryption-offering/ "keybase") was done entirely on zoom, and in some ways that works even better
 - Difficult to keep a transaction war room within the company confidential since people see that happening in person
 
Elena
- We're always looking opportunistically to see what might complement our roadmap
- Not changing that stance, we're approaching this per usual, not more or less due to covid
- Remote M&A is not a complete blocker

**Do you see budgets increasing for employee benefits or other retention areas?**
