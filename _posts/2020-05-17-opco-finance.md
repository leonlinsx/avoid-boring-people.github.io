**Main**

I've summarised talks by [Operator Collective](https://operatorcollective.com/about/ "Op Co") \[1\] from [COOs](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/how-to-get-back-to-better "coo") and CMOs recently, and will be doing another summary today [for a talk they did with CFOs on enterprise spending.](https://vimeo.com/417796182 "event") 

Their talk involved Elena Gomez, Zendesk CFO and Kelly Steckelberg, Zoom CFO \[2\]. Notes below will sometimes be paraphrased for clarity, and cover the following topics:

Highlights for me were:

**1st**

**What challenges are your companies facing?**

Elena 
- Just like a lot of other companies, really focusing on the customer, helping them navigate volatility
- Also focused on employee safety, trying to be as agile as we can
- Focused on prioritisation more than we'd typically be at this point in the year

Kelly
- While our daily participants have 30x, our staff did not
- Biggest challenge has been scaling our ability to support the customer, and that started with bandwidth
- Also making sure we take care of employees with their needs in the pandemic

**Any tips for making daily standups more effective?**

Elena
- Making sure it's not a prescribed agenda but more fluid, top of mind, oriented to employees and customers
- More casual, informal. More important to have the discussion than the 20 page deck

Kelly
- We also do ours quickly, so everyone is focused 

**How are you changing your spending?**

Elena
- Not immediately a budget cut, but a look across the company investments and which we want to preserve for growth
- Preserve engineering capacity, sales quota capacity as a starting point since without those you can't grow
- Then we look at the supporting functions, and it isn't an immediate "Let's just cut G&A" because that's too blunt of a cut. Where do we have G&A investments that support growth? 
- Relax hiring to a degree where we can absorb it more

Kelly
- Found that we had to adjust our annual budget on almost a monthly basis post covid. We're doing monthly reviews of spending and looking at asks that are coming up
- Some obvious things like travel, events, we're looking at redeploying those budgets
- Looking at things on a short term cadence since we can't look at an annual or even quarterly budget anymore
- Sales org, anything that relates to supporting our customers, we want to ensure they still have capacity
