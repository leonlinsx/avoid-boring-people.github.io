**Takeaways**

**Question of the month**

If you have been affected by the crisis and think I could help, please reply directly to this email and we'll problem solve together.

****

**Fluctuat nec mergitur**

I can't predict when this crisis will end. I hope it's soon, though I fear it's not.

What I can predict is that this crisis will show people for who they really are. There will be [those that help](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-doctors-retired/2020/03/28/075dbda0-6f0f-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html "doctor") and [those that harm](https://www.independent.ie/world-news/coronavirus/they-could-kill-someone-gang-of-youths-cough-on-nurse-39074300.html "youth"). Those that keep their word and those that break it. Those that make their reputation and those that disgrace it. 

Choose which group you want to be. Choose wisely.

I have no doubt that we will pull through this. Bruised but not broken, we'll recover having reassessed who and what matters most. And one day we'll be telling stories of how we came together as a community and survived. 

I also have no doubt that these will sound like hollow platitudes if you've been personally affected by the crisis. In my biggest failures, I heard them all - time heals all wounds, failure is one step to success, losing opens up new opportunities. I instinctively knew them to be true, but honestly didn't give a shit. 

And that's ok. It's ok to be feeling what you're feeling now. Frightened. Distraught. Lost. 

But know that those feelings will fade, and you're better than your temporary temperaments. [For man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed but not defeated.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/111352-but-man-is-not-made-for-defeat-he-said-a "Defeat") You'll rise again, should you choose. People are ready to help.

If you do need help, there are some resources in the "Other" section below that might be worth checking out.

And if you're fortunate enough to be able to help, the "Other" section also highlights ways to do so. 

The city of Paris has a motto, [Fluctuat nec mergitur,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Paris "Paris") meaning "tossed by the waves, but does not sink". We're in for a rocky time, but will weather this storm as we always have, by helping each other. Reach out, even if it's just to one person. You can make a larger difference than you think. 

> If I can stop one heart from breaking,
> I shall not live in vain;
> If I can ease one life the aching,
> Or cool one pain,
> Or help one fainting robin
> Unto his nest again,
> I shall not live in vain \[31\]
