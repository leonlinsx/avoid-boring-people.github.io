We use rating systems all the time: restaurant google maps ratings, uber driver ratings, mobile app ratings. However, at best they're a noisy indicator of quality, at worst they hinder rather than help affect your decision making. Josh Breinlinger of Jackson Square discusses why [here](https://www.slideshare.net/jbreinlinger/marketplace-pricing-and-feedback "Feedback") and proposes some solutions.

> Ppl focus too much on separation at first, when they should focus on the optimisation post acceptance

> 5 star ratings can separate bad sellers but don't have enough granularity to separate good vs great

> ELO ratings more resemble reality

> Relative vs absolute

In a separate post, Josh talks about [using response rate as a signal as well](https://acrowdedspace.com/post/186004771432/response-rate-is-a-quality-signal "response rate")

> 3 different types of pricing models

> Rake factors

> Who pays the fee
