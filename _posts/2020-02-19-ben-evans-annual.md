> We connected (almost) everyone. There are 5.5bn adults on earth, 5bn have a phone and 4bn have a smartphone 

> New technologies come in S Curves (from stupid to exciting to boring), and mobile has mostly reached the boring stage

> Two main questions now: What happens when everyone is online? What are the next S Curves?

> And a third question: Regulation and policy

**Ecommerce**

> ecommerce is big...But still ‘only’ 15% of addressable retail

> Independent ecommerce is now so big that the enabling platforms are worth tens of billions e.g. Shopify, Stripe

> Amazon has grown, though its value proposition as a platform for others is now a third of its revenue

> New retailing means new taxes e.g. AMZN product search, Booking/Expedia Google search

> This has happened before though, unless you have a new route to awareness

**TV**

> For generations, most of the US was sold a big and expensive pay TV bundle - this is now breaking apart. Took a decade from youtube for pay TV subscribers to start declining

> The change is happening faster than retail, and is most pronounced in teens

> New forms of video are emerging, such as Twitch games live streaming

> Unbundling and Rebundling: There can only be so many brand relationships, Aggregators exist for a reason, Lots of rebundling coming

**Other**

> A model that only worked for narrow segments a decade ago now expands into the whole economy e.g. RigUp for oil field workers, Honor for elderly care, Incredible Health for nursing

> Expanding software and tools from work to everyday life

> More and more investment in company creation around the world

**The next S curves**

> The tech industry has had a new centre roughly every 15 years e.g. mainframes to PCs to web to mobile. What's next?

> New things such as machine learning, crypto, AR are happening, but that's not the only focus for 2020s

> Regulation is a big thing coming to tech

> Complex questions seem to have simple answers that don't stand up to scrutiny

> Coverage of real issues also seems more focused on creating moral panic

> Deciding what a company's market share is can be difficult. e.g. AMZN has a GMV share of ecommerce 35% vs a GMV + Stores share of total
retail

> Few of the issues that make people worry about ‘big tech’ relate to anti-trust

> We won’t regulate ‘tech’ – we’ll have lots of different regulation for different issues and companies

> There are always tradeoffs in regulation. e.g. "There’s bad stuff on your platform – take it down"

**GLobal tech**

> China and India internet usage is now bigger than the US

> We're seeing a clash of different country regulations

> The only certainty: regulation as a regressive tax. Much of regulation is a fixed cost that affects new entrants disproportionately

> Tech has become part of the world, so it gets regulated as part of the world

> Worrying about tech isn’t new

> Every wave of tech changes the world, and gets regulated
