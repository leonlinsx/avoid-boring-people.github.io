[Ben Evans of the venture capital firm a16z](https://www.ben-evans.com/ "ben") did his [annual presentation on tech recently.](https://www.ben-evans.com/presentations "presentation") It's similar in style to [Mary Meeker's internet trends annual report](https://www.bondcap.com/report/itr19/#view/title "Bond"), though less lenghty or diverse. I'll highlight key points below.

He talks about a few broad themes:

  - Now that everyone is connected to the internet, what can we expect in areas such as ecommerce, entertainment, and other industries?
  - What is the next tech trend, now that we've hit a plateau in smartphones?
  - How will regulation evolve to deal with tech?

> We connected (almost) everyone. There are 5.5bn adults on earth, 5bn have a phone and 4bn have a smartphone

By some estimates there are [~4.5bn people connected to the internet now](https://www.internetworldstats.com/top20.htm "internet"), through a mix of phone and computers. Some of the countries that make the top 20 in terms of total connected users might be surprising: Nigeria, Bangladesh, Philippines combined have about the same number of internet users as the US, due to those countries' large population size.

However, there's a difference between everyone being connected to the internet, and everyone being connected to each other. We were sold on this vision that anyone would talk to anyone, but that's not been the case. From immense isolations like China's tech scene, to small segreations such as Quora being mainly users from India, we still live apart from each other \[1\].

> New technologies come in S Curves (from stupid to exciting to boring), and mobile has mostly reached the boring stage

For those unfamiliar, [the S curve concept](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-S-curve-concept-of-technology-life-cycle_fig3_256859390 "S curve") models how a technology's life cycle is not linear. Instead, it follows an S shape, if the shape had been drawn by something with as bad handwriting as I do: 

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Ben Evans S curve 1.jpg)

Ben's point is that mobile is no longer accelerating, and people have reset their expectations to a new level where mobile is the norm.

Ben discusses the impact that everyone being online will have on ecommerce, entertainment, and other industries. Let's look at ecommerce first.

**Ecommerce**

> ecommerce is big...But still ‘only’ 15% of addressable retail \[2\]

Notably, Ben's "addressable" market excludes cars or restaurants, which have historically been offline experiences. That may no longer be the case, with internet sites and apps allowing [car purchases](https://www.autotrader.com/ "Auto") or [food delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meituan-Dianping "Meituan"). [You can even buy houses online now](https://www.opendoor.com/w/guides/what-is-an-ibuyer "opendoor")

> Independent ecommerce is now so big that the enabling platforms are worth tens of billions e.g. Shopify, Stripe

This trend has been a surprise to investors, which can be inferred by how the valuations of infrastructure companies such as Shopify (makes ecommerce easier) or Stripe (makes payments easier) have exploded over the past years. We knew that there would be many people online. We didn't realise how large a business opportunity it would be to provide a [long tail](https://www.wired.com/2004/10/tail/ "tail") of users with business services at a low cost. 

> Amazon has grown, though being a platform for others now contributes a third of its revenue

Ben's referring to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the AMZN marketplace. AWS provides cloud computing. The AMZN marketplace is when AMZN acts as a 3rd party platform to let other merchants sell on the AMZN site \[3\]. Both of these business lines are now significant for AMZN, deriving value similarly from that long tail of users as just discussed.

> New retailing means new taxes e.g. AMZN product search, Booking/Expedia Google search

Stores have to pay rent in order to physically reach customers. When your store moves from the physical to the intangigle internet, you pay a digital rent instead. [Customer acquisition cost (CAC) is the new rent](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201805/tom-foster/direct-consumer-brands-middleman-warby-parker.html "CAC"). This takes various forms, such as paying AMZN a fee to advertise your product, or buying ads on Google. 

Ben also makes the point that this shift in rent isn't new, and has happened whenever there's a shift in business trends. The exception is when you can find a unique way to reach your customers directly without a middleman. Some investors thought that the new DTC companies such as Casper (mattress company) were the exception, but have been proven wrong so far.

Besides ecommerce, Ben also discusses TV and entertainment: 

**TV**

> For generations, most of the US was sold a big and expensive pay TV bundle - this is now breaking apart. 

> Unbundling and Rebundling: There can only be so many brand relationships, Aggregators exist for a reason, Lots of rebundling coming

There's a saying that business is all about [bundling and unbundling](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling "HBR"), or packaging value together and then separating it into pieces. Ben believes that after this current wave of fragmented sales, companies will emerge to consolidate the sectors into oligopolies. 

> Took a decade from youtube's founding, but pay TV subscribers have started declining. The change is happening faster than retail, and is most pronounced in teenagers

> New forms of video are emerging, such as Twitch games live streaming

We haven't stopped needing entertainment; we've just moved on to different channels. Despite that, [the average person still watches 4 hours of TV](https://www.statista.com/chart/15224/daily-tv-consumption-by-us-adults/ "TV"), implying there's still way more to go in this shift. 

TV was one way and passive due to tech limitations with information speed. Newer forms of entertainment take advantage of the increased speed now by experimenting with two way, interactive formats. Hosts can now chat with their viewers directly, get their feedback on what they'd like to see, and even sell them merchandise.

Live streaming isn't limited to games either, if you thought it was a niche hobby. The in real life (IRL) channels on Twitch have [grow in popularity](https://esportsobserver.com/twitch-irl-2018/ "IRL"), and live entertainment apps in China are big. People now expect to be able to interact with the influencer and pretend they are close, perhaps having been conditioned with the rise of social media. 

**Other**

> A model that only worked for narrow segments a decade ago now expands into the whole economy e.g. RigUp for oil field workers, Honor for elderly care, Incredible Health for nursing

> Expanding software and tools from work to everyday life

> More and more investment in company creation around the world

**The next S curves**

> The tech industry has had a new centre roughly every 15 years e.g. mainframes to PCs to web to mobile. What's next?

> New things such as machine learning, crypto, AR are happening, but that's not the only focus for 2020s

> Regulation is a big thing coming to tech

> Complex questions seem to have simple answers that don't stand up to scrutiny

> Coverage of real issues also seems more focused on creating moral panic

> Deciding what a company's market share is can be difficult. e.g. AMZN has a GMV share of ecommerce 35% vs a GMV + Stores share of total retail

> Few of the issues that make people worry about ‘big tech’ relate to anti-trust

> We won’t regulate ‘tech’ – we’ll have lots of different regulation for different issues and companies

> There are always tradeoffs in regulation. e.g. "There’s bad stuff on your platform – take it down"

**Global tech**

> China and India internet usage is now bigger than the US

> We're seeing a clash of different country regulations

> The only certainty: regulation as a regressive tax. Much of regulation is a fixed cost that affects new entrants disproportionately

> Tech has become part of the world, so it gets regulated as part of the world

> Worrying about tech isn’t new

> Every wave of tech changes the world, and gets regulated

**Footnotes**

1. Think about how many internet friends you have from China, India, Indonesia, or Brazil (if not your home country), which have the 4 largest internet users outside of the US.
2. Addressable retail = ex. cars, car parts, gasoline, restaurants & bars
3. This is in contrast to being a first party merchant, when AMZN is the one buying and reselling the items. 3rd party marketplace value of goods sold (GMV) is now larger than 1st party sales, though the revenue to AMZN is still lower.
