I attended a webinar with [John Chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Chambers "John") recently, below are the takeaways:

- Ppl don't like to talk about mistakes but I think it's important, even more so than talking about successes. 
- Hence I'll start by talking about mistakes. What were my biggest mistakes?
  - In 2001 Cisco was on a roll, we had been forecasting growth accurately, had been beating Street estimates consistently for 30+ quarters in a row
  - We were forecasting 30% growth for the next period, and then went from high growth to -30% decline very quickly in 2001 crisis as customers pulled back
  - How I learnt from this was in 2007 when we saw some signs of slowdown despite overall market being bullish, and we were able to prepare for that and manage cashflow accordingly
  - We emerged stronger than everyone else from 2007 because of experience in 2001
- What makes a good leader?
  - Do what you say you'll do
  - Your currency is your track record, relationship, and trust
- Cisco's ability to run a playbook was crucial to success
  - e.g. we did many acquisitions while I was there, partially because we were able to replicate a playbook for each acquisition to run the process smoothly
  - learn from your experiences
- There's much more change in today's job market than the past. 
  - I've had 3 jobs in my career, but my children are already on their 3rd job, and people now will probably go through 10+ jobs in their career
  - Don't teach ppl how to do an occupation, but how to learn and change instead
- If you're trying to convince ppl of something, ppl don't remember all the points, you have to learn how to tell stories
- Long term thinking
  - At cisco I wasn't focused on quarters, and I wanted competitors to be focused on quarters
  - Most companies now are run with too much short term, quarterly focus
- Companies fail by doing the same successful thing too often 
  - e.g. west virginia in 3 decades became #50 on most measures of wellness
  - If you don't change you'll get left behind
  - People may say that's all part of the natural cycle of things, but it's not a natural occurrence at all. Other states deliberately engineered change for their success
  - If you keep doing the right thing for too long it will get you in trouble 
  - e.g. walmart, I was on board, we saw AMZN threat but didn't focus on it until it was too late
  - You can be smart but predictable e.g. bridge players that were engineers, and that makes you easier to beat
- Maintaining success is about speed and getting out of your comfort zone
  - When this happens to you though it's hard
  - You will fail, will be uncomfortable
  - But if you don't change, integrate and understand new tech, you'll get left behind e.g AI, 5G in this current time
- Great companies must be customer obsessed
  - 80% of ceos thinks they have great customer service but only 10% customers think the same
  - At cisco we drove strategy by asking customers what they wanted
  - Behind all of our 180 acquisitions it was always customers pushing and giving thumbs up to the decision
  - We were always customer driven, did what customers think was important
  - Customers would trust us
- I knew most acquisitions would fail just by the probabilities
  - In high tech industries when you buy a company you're buying ppl and the next gen product
  - 90% will fail
   - If you think you'll do things differently and are immune to this you're going to be wrong
   - Don't acquire companies with different culture
- What's your investment criteria as a VC now?
  - They have to be involved a transition point for both business and the overall industry
  - Management as well
- I believe almost all job creation in the next few years will come from startups
  - We have to create a good environment for startups
  - IPOs now are half the number compared to the internet boom
  - There are likely not enough companies in the pipeline for the economy to do well in next decade
- How did you know you were seeing the right signals at cisco for success?
  - Listen to what customers were saying. Focus on competitors in terms of keeping score of how you're doing vs them
  - Follow every critical account of the company all the time, listen to problems 
- I also believe that if people stay in a role for 4+ years they'll get bored
- I was once told that I won't have a great company until we have a near death experience
  - As a leader you have to be the rock for the company in that time
  - This anecdote was proven right after going through the crisis
- Another piece of advice I was given was to always take time to go to bathroom
  - What he meant was that I should come out of a meeting and take time to summarise and reflect on it. You need to be in the right state of mind and preparation for the next meeting
- I studied competitors not for their strategy but to understand how their CEO behaved
  - e.g. ceo had history in concentration camp, that would affect their behaviour
  - e.g. bridge players were smart but predictable, similar analogy to CEO behaviour
