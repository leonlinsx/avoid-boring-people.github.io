Ppl don't like to talk about mistakes but I think it's important, more so than talking about successes. What were my biggest mistakes?Cisco in 2001 was on a roll, we had been forecasting growth accurately, beating street consistently for 30+ quarters in a rowWe were forecasting 30% growth, and then went from high growth to -30% decline very quickly in 2001 crisisHow I learnt from this was in 2007 when we saw some signs of slowdown despite overall market being bullish, and were able to prepare for that and manage cashflow accordinglyWe emerged stronger than everyone elseWhat makes a good leader?Do what you say you'll doYour currency is your track record, relationship, and trustCisco's ability to run a playbook was crucial to successe.g. we did many acquisitions while I was there, partially because we were able to replicate a playbook for each acquisition to run the process smoothlylearn from your experiences
There's much more change in today's job mkt than the past. I had 3 jobs, my children are already on their 3rd job, and probably will go through 10+ jobs in their careerDon't teach ppl how to do an occupation, but how to learn and change insteadIf you're trying to convince ppl of something, ppl don't remember all the points, you have to learn how to tell storiesLong term thinkingAt cisco i wasn't focused on quarters but I wanted competitors to beMost companies now are run with too much short term, quarterly focusCompanies fail by doing the same successful thing to often e.g. west virginia in 3 decades became #50 on most wellness measuresIf you don't change you'll get left behindPeople may say that's all part of the natural cycle of things, but it's not a natural occurrence at all. Other states deliberately engineered change for their successIf you keep doing the right thing for too long it will get you in trouble e.g. walmart, I was on board, we saw AMZN threat but didn't focus on it until it was too lateYou can be smart but predictable e.g. bridge players that were engineers, and that makes you easier to beatMaintaining success is about speed and getting out of your comfort zoneWhen this happens to you though it's hardYou will fail, will be uncomfortableBut if you don't change, integrate and understand new tech, you'll get left behind e.g AI, 5G etcGreat companies must be customer obsessed80% of ceos thinks they have great customer service but only 10% customers think the sameAt cisco we drove strategy by asking customers what they wantedBehind all of our 180 acquisitions it was always customers pushing and giving thumbs up to the decisionWe were always customer driven, did what customers think was importantCustomers would trust usi knew most acquisitions would fail just by the probabilitiesIn high tech industries when you buy a company you're buying ppl and the next gen product90% will failIf you think you'll do things differently you're going to be wrongDon't acquire companies with different cultureWhat's your investment criteria as a VC now?They have to be involved a transition point for both business and the overall industryManagement as wellI believe almost all job creation in the next few years will come from startupsWe have to create a good environment for startupsIPOs now are half the number compared to the internet boomThere are likely not enough companies in the pipeline for the economy to do well in next decadeHow did you know you were seeing the right signals at cisco?Listen to what customers were saying. Focus on competitors in terms of keeping score of how you're doing vs themFollow every critical account of the company all the time, listen to problems Also believe that if people stay in a role for 4+ years they'll get boredI was once told that I won't have a great company until have near death expAs a leader you have to be the rock for the companyWas proven right after going through the crisisAnother piece of advice I was given was to always take time to go to bathroomWhat he meant was that I should come out of a meeting and take time to summarise and reflect on it. You need to be in the right state of mind and preparation for the next meetingI studied competitors not for their strategy but to understand how their CEO behavede.g. ceo had history in concentration camp, that would affect their behavioure.g. bridge players were smart but predictable, similar analogy to CEO behaviour
