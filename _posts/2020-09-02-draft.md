I'm on a panel with [Polina Marinova](https://theprofile.substack.com/about "polina") and [Josh Sternberg](https://medianut.substack.com/ "Josh") at the [EllisX Media Conference](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/forward-by-ellisx-the-future-of-media-and-startup-exposure-tickets-115770654143 "event"), discussing how newsletters are creating a media renaissance.
