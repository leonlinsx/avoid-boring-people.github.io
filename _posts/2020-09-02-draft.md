I used to travel to Toronto for work.

There was a restaurant I liked to visit, with excellent food, drinks, and staff \[1\]. I'd half hoped to become a regular there, tasting every item on the menu and swapping cocktail chit chat with the bartenders.

No more.

I used to host cocktail nights.

I'd invite guests to my apartment while I served drinks, shaken or stirred. Sometimes we even did cocktail lessons. It'd turned into a sustainable, recurring affair where I could catch up with old friends or make new ones.

No more.

I used to do monthly group dinners.

We'd pick a restaurant in Manhattan, reserve a date weeks in advance, and then share food and stories. Group dinners are great; they mean more meals to try. 

[No more no more no more.](https://youtu.be/a8HoZlhenZ4?t=141 "Dr Who")

I've been lucky this year, all things considered. I'm still alive, still healthy, still have a job. No major losses. 

And yet, there is this foreboding feeling something's disappeared. 

I don't think it's just me either. I'm seeing more posts about people feeling listless these days. That gym buddy you've never spoken to but always comes at the same time you do, the bartender you thought was flirting with you but is just being friendly, or the friend that you're ok talking to once a quarter but no more than that; turns out they all contributed in some small way to the sense of community you felt in your city.

That's gone for now, and people have reacted in different ways. Some search for community via virtual avenues, others are trying to go without. 

Today I want to explore that theme, **of community and individuality,** from a few different angles. We'll first look at the events and groups that have adapted for the individual seeking community. Then, we'll look at the rise of the individual in media, particularly the newsletter business. We'll end off with an overview of the individual in investing, particularly solo venture capitalists \[2\].

#### 1. Virtual events and groups should aim to build communities

Virtual events and groups are not new. This article from *2009* discusses how:

> The struggling economy that has forced many companies to reduce their travel budgets and an increased focus on being "green" \[...\] have converged to make virtual shows a realistic endeavor for the conference business.

And most of us are familiar with [MSN messenger,](https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/msn-messenger-logged-back-in-3393323 "msn") [online forums](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-we-talk-online-a-history-of-online-forums-from-cavemen-days-to-the-present/ "forum"), and social media today, all of which are ways people found each other online.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Community/Community 2.png)

While the main ideas themselves aren't new, technology improvements and changing social norms have led to enhanced execution of the concepts. Let's first see how events have adapted, and then look into groups.

##### Virtual events should aim for more interaction

If you're like me, your current days probably are a mix of working from home, sleeping at home, and finding something to entertain yourself at home that doesn't involve re-binging all 7 seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer \[3\]. 

I've attended, volunteered at, and hosted a bunch of different virtual events in the past few months. Most have been mundane, a few have been exceptional. Here are my highlights:

Many event organisers seem to believe that all you have to do is just convert all your event sessions to a zoom call. Email out a calendar invite link, play a few minutes of "can you grant me host powers so I can share my screen," and have the speaker talk as though it were an in person event. This works alright, but I find it to be the bare minimum of what we should expect in 2020.

One simple and high value-add to events is to **allow for audience Q&A.** It's a convenient way to increase interaction during your event and make it more effective. It also means there's a real difference between attending the event live vs watching a replay. Most organisers have understood this by now, though time allocated for Q&A can still be on the shorter side. I'd advocate for about half the time of your speaking event to be dedicated to Q&A, especially if the purpose of your event is to build a relationship with the audience \[4\].

Another value-add is to **include the materials presented.** You can do this before or after the session, depending on whether you want to have the element of surprise. So many events I've attended just send me replay links of the video. That's good, and we can do better. If I want to cite your expertise later on, it's more convenient to link to static rather than dynamic material, since it takes more time to parse through video content. Since it's essentially free and easy to do so, you should aim to save your audience's time.

The other ideas I've seen are more situational.

If you have a small group and want to facilitate people connecting one on one, I've found [Icebreaker](https://icebreaker.video/ "Icebreaker") great for that use case. Icebreaker gathers everyone in a main room, before randomly splitting people up into 1x1 chats. The 1x1s also have guided prompts, in case people don't know what to talk about. After 5 min, the chats automatically end, and everyone's sent back to the main room. You can repeat this as many times as you want. 

If you have a large group and still want people to interact on their own, you might want to follow what the [2020 Nebula Awards](https://events.sfwa.org/ "SFWA") did. The Nebulas are [one of the most prestigious Sci Fi awards,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_Award "Nebula") and this year did their entire conference online. They hosted an enormous amount of zoom breakout rooms with different sizes, from a single link. They then gave every attendee co-host powers so that the attendees could move around the breakout rooms and join whatever they felt was interesting. Besides having a main speaker room, they had random rooms such as a bar with a bartender teaching recipes, a writing room, and a puppy live stream. Below you can see me in a breakout room with famous scifi author [Lois Bujold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_McMaster_Bujold "Lois") (I've blacked out the other people for privacy).

A more experimental idea that I had mixed feelings on was [Online Town](https://theonline.town/ "Online"), which the [Long Now Foundation](https://longnow.org/seminars/ "Long") tried after one of their seminars. In Online Town, you're represented by an avatar on the screen, and you can walk around a room just like you'd walk around in real life. The conversations that you can listen to are based on proximity, further simulating reality. I found the idea interesting, and it requires much higher user education, for a more unique experience.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Community/Community 4.gif)

So far we've covered "work" related events, but entertainers have adapted virtually as well. 

For example, I watched an [Ellie Goulding live virtual concert recently.](https://inews.co.uk/culture/music/ellie-goulding-live-review-victoria-and-albert-museum-london-brightest-blue-613122 "Ellie") She held it at the [Victoria and Albert Museum](https://www.vam.ac.uk/ "VAM") in London, putting on a fantastic show that moved about in the museum. The production quality was awesome, and it got great feedback on social media.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Community/Community 5.png)

Another example is [Tomorrowland](https://www.tomorrowland.com/global/ "TMR"), the premier DJ festival. They also turned up the production quality, [creating visual experiences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BinQqIX3aig "alan") that concertgoers could enjoy while listening to their DJs play their set live. I didn't attend, but a person who did said she enjoyed it.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Community/Community 6.png)

However, I think we can do even better. Ellie's concert was excellent, and Tomorrowland seems fun, but both lacked engagement with fans \[5\]. If you're having a live event, you should make the most of it. Digital experiences simplify communication, and I'd advocate that **entertainment events should aim for interaction, just like the "professional" events above.** If all your live event has going for it is high production value, I might as well just watch the replay on my own time.

KT Tunstall exemplified this in [her live session with the Royal Albert Hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_FHtCvpTOI "KT"). You can see the lower production quality compared to the two examples above, but what really made the difference was the live chat. It allowed fans to interact both with each other and with her, making for a special, intimate feeling session. Live streaming has become... mainstream. 

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Community/Community 7.png)

If you don't believe that's sustainable at scale, then take a look at [what KPop groups such as Super Junior are doing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H_MiOghwJw&fbclid=IwAR3nFY0s2ccu6tXA4dig9_e37jvNC3QGxCNOL9WE9E-DyJeRMrWtoMAQUIo "Kpop") They've re-imagined the concert experience, and specifically plan for fan interaction in the concert. It's so much easier to make fans feel special now. It's increasingly felt to me that Asian companies are leading the way in innovating on consumer experiences, and this feels like another case study for Western companies \[6\].

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Community/Community 8.png)

In summary, events should aim for more interaction to build community. It's even easier to do so now, and will result in an even more fanatical following.

#### 2. Media

In the world of content, individuals are choosing the opportunity to influence and earn by themselves. By going independent, they're giving up some stability and support from the platform, in exchange for higher reward and responsibility. I want to focus on the newsletter industry today, although this trend isn't unique to it - youtube, twitch, tiktok, tencent video, onlyfans are all examples of the individual finding success today by [unbundling the value of their personal content.](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling "bundle")

Let's look at:

- What's driving the trend of newsletter creation
- What the business model and economics could be for a newsletter at scale
- What the future of media could look like

writing community, scholarships

cost and convenience

### Footnotes

1. [Aloette](https://aloetterestaurant.com/ "Aloette") for the curious.
2. To be clear, I'm not making the case that Covid *caused* these trends. It may have accelerated some, and had no effect on others. I'm more trying to explore the general theme of community from different interpretations
3. Having watched this for the first time, I'm surprised by how many of its great episodes still hold up. Also, the Spike/Buffy relationship is really creepy both ways man.
4. Having Q&A means you'll need to be more effective at moderating, which isn't that big a deal most of the time.
5. That was the primary reason I didn't get a ticket for Tomorrowland, since I didn't see the value add.
6. For example, tipping or subscribing to live streamers has been a large market for China streamers, and took off later for Western ones
