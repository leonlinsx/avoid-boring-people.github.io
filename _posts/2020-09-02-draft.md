### Takeaways

1. Virtual events and groups should aim to build community by increasing interaction and engagement. If you aren't in a community or building one, you're probably missing out.

I used to travel to Toronto for work.

There was a restaurant I liked to visit, with excellent food, drinks, and staff \[1\]. I'd half hoped to become a regular there, tasting every item on the menu and swapping cocktail chit chat with the bartenders.

No more.

I used to host cocktail nights.

I'd invite guests to my apartment while I served drinks. Sometimes we even did cocktail lessons. It'd turned into a sustainable, recurring affair where I could catch up with old friends or make new ones.

No more.

I used to do monthly group dinners.

We'd pick a restaurant in Manhattan, reserve a date weeks in advance, and then share food and stories. Group dinners are great; they mean more meals to try. 

[No more no more no more.](https://youtu.be/a8HoZlhenZ4?t=141 "Dr Who")

I've been lucky this year, all things considered. I'm still alive, still healthy, still have a job. No major losses. 

And yet, there is this foreboding feeling *something* has disappeared. 

I don't think it's just me either. I'm seeing more posts about people feeling listless these days. That gym buddy you've never spoken to but always comes at the same time you do, the bartender you thought was flirting with you but is just being friendly, or the friend that you're ok talking to once a quarter but no more than that; turns out they all contributed in some small way to the sense of community you felt in your city.

That's gone for now, and people have reacted in different ways. Some search for community via virtual avenues, others are trying to go without. It's never been easier to find others, and also never been easier to be alone.

Today I want to explore that theme, **of community and individuality,** from a few different angles. We'll first look at the events and groups that have adapted for the individual seeking community. Then, we'll look at the rise of the individual in media, particularly the newsletter business. We'll end off with an overview of the individual in investing, particularly solo venture capitalists \[2\].

#### 1. Virtual events and groups should aim to build communities

Virtual events and groups are not new. This article from *2009* discusses how:

> The struggling economy that has forced many companies to reduce their travel budgets and an increased focus on being "green" \[...\] have converged to make virtual shows a realistic endeavor for the conference business.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Community/Community 1.png)

And most of us are familiar with [MSN messenger,](https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/msn-messenger-logged-back-in-3393323 "msn") [online forums](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-we-talk-online-a-history-of-online-forums-from-cavemen-days-to-the-present/ "forum"), and social media today, all of which are ways people found each other online.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Community/Community 2.png)

While the main ideas themselves aren't new, technology improvements and changing social norms have led to enhanced execution of the concepts. Let's first see how events have adapted, and then look into groups.

##### Virtual events as interactive activities

If you're like me, your current days probably are a mix of working from home, sleeping at home, and finding something to entertain yourself at home that doesn't involve re-binging all 7 seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer \[3\]. 

I've attended, volunteered at, and hosted a bunch of different virtual events in the past few months. Most have been mundane, a few have been exceptional. Here are my highlights:

Many event organisers seem to believe that all you have to do is just convert all your event sessions to a zoom call. Email out a calendar invite link, play a few minutes of "can you grant me host powers so I can share my screen," and have the speaker talk as though it were an in person event. This works alright, but I find it to be the bare minimum of what we should expect in 2020.

One simple and high value-add to events is to **allow for audience Q&A.** It's a convenient way to increase interaction during your event and make it more effective. It also means there's a real difference between attending the event live vs watching a replay. Most organisers have understood this by now, though time allocated for Q&A can still be on the shorter side. I'd advocate for about half the time of your speaking event to be dedicated to Q&A, especially if the purpose of your event is to build a relationship with the audience \[4\].

Another value-add is to **include the materials presented.** You can do this before or after the session, depending on whether you want to have the element of surprise. So many events I've attended just send me replay links of the video. That's good, and we can do better. If I want to cite your expertise later on, it's more convenient to link to static rather than dynamic material, since it takes more time to parse through video content. Since it's essentially free and easy to do so, you should aim to save your audience's time.

The other ideas I've seen are more situational.

If you have a small group and want to facilitate people connecting one on one, I've found [Icebreaker](https://icebreaker.video/ "Icebreaker") great for that use case. Icebreaker gathers everyone in a main room, before randomly splitting people up into 1x1 chats. The 1x1s also have guided prompts, in case people don't know what to talk about. After 5 min, the chats automatically end, and everyone's sent back to the main room. You can repeat this as many times as you want. 

If you have a large group and still want people to interact on their own, you might want to follow what the [2020 Nebula Awards](https://events.sfwa.org/ "SFWA") did. The Nebulas are [one of the most prestigious Sci Fi awards,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_Award "Nebula") and this year did their entire conference online. They hosted an enormous amount of zoom breakout rooms with different sizes, from a single link. They then gave every attendee co-host powers so that the attendees could move around the breakout rooms and join whatever they felt was interesting. Besides having a main speaker room, they had random rooms such as a bar with a bartender teaching recipes, a writing room, and a puppy live stream. Below you can see me in a breakout room with famous scifi author [Lois Bujold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_McMaster_Bujold "Lois") (I've blacked out the other people for privacy).

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Community/Community 3.png)

A more experimental idea that I had mixed feelings on was [Online Town](https://theonline.town/ "Online"), which the [Long Now Foundation](https://longnow.org/seminars/ "Long") tried after one of their seminars. In Online Town, you're represented by an avatar on the screen, and you can walk around a room just like you'd walk around in real life. The conversations that you can listen to are based on proximity, further simulating reality. I found the idea interesting, and it requires much higher user education, for a more unique experience.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Community/Community 4.gif)   

So far we've covered "work" related events, but entertainers have adapted virtually as well. 

For example, I watched an [Ellie Goulding live virtual concert recently.](https://inews.co.uk/culture/music/ellie-goulding-live-review-victoria-and-albert-museum-london-brightest-blue-613122 "Ellie") She held it at the [Victoria and Albert Museum](https://www.vam.ac.uk/ "VAM") in London, putting on a fantastic show that moved about in the museum. The production quality was awesome, and it got great feedback on social media.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Community/Community 5.png)

Another example is [Tomorrowland](https://www.tomorrowland.com/global/ "TMR"), the premier DJ festival. They also turned up the production quality, [creating visual experiences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BinQqIX3aig "alan") that concertgoers could enjoy while listening to their DJs play their set live. I didn't attend, but a person who did said she enjoyed it.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Community/Community 6.png)

However, I think we can do even better. Ellie's concert was excellent, and Tomorrowland seems fun, but both lacked engagement with fans \[5\]. If you're having a live event, you should make the most of it. Digital experiences simplify communication, and I'd advocate that **entertainment events should aim for interaction, just like the "professional" events above.** If all your live event has going for it is high production value, I might as well just watch the replay on my own time.

KT Tunstall exemplified this in [her live session with the Royal Albert Hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_FHtCvpTOI "KT"). You can see the lower production quality compared to the two examples above, but what really made the difference was the live chat. It allowed fans to interact both with each other and with her, making for a special intimate session. Live streaming has become... mainstream. 

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Community/Community 7.png)

If you don't believe that's sustainable at scale, then take a look at [what KPop groups such as Super Junior are doing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H_MiOghwJw&fbclid=IwAR3nFY0s2ccu6tXA4dig9_e37jvNC3QGxCNOL9WE9E-DyJeRMrWtoMAQUIo "Kpop") They've re-imagined the concert experience, and specifically plan for fan interaction in the concert. It's so much easier to make fans feel special now, and entertainers should learn from this. It's increasingly felt to me that Asian companies are leading the way in innovating on consumer experiences, and this feels like another case study for Western companies \[6\].

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Community/Community 8.png)

What does this mean for the in person event market? [Rafat Ali of Skift believes that this is a watershed moment for the industry](https://skift.com/2020/08/26/the-event-industry-is-being-confronted-by-its-napster-moment/ "Skift"), just like what Napster for music. He thinks that 10% of business travel may leave the market permanently, and also estimates that virtual events make about a quarter the amount of revenue that in person ones do, so the market will have to adapt to new economics. 

I'm less pessimistic about in person events, and feel that those will re-grow once covid passes. Most business conferences have usually been less about efficiency and more about the networking and taking a paid vacation away from your boss. However, I see events adopting a hybrid model, which could even be incremental to their margins. Sell the in person experience as a luxury, and the virtual experience as a budget substitute. This implies that knowing how to host good virtual events will still be important for the future.

In summary, virtual events should aim for more interaction to build community. It's even easier to do so now, and will result in an even more fanatical following.

##### Virtual communities as curated clubs

Community building has also risen in importance, both for individuals and companies. For the individual, networking has always been relevant, and virtual groups are an extension of that. For companies, an engaged community implies loyal customers, lowering churn and customer acquisition costs (CAC); the company version of the [1,000 true fans for creators.](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/ "1000")

On the individual level, the problem with communities is **a matter of selectivity.** Too selective, and you're not having enough random encounters. Not selective, and you find everything irrelevant. Being a member of a community is a form of [signalling,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics) "signal") and how strong or weak that signal is depends on how cool your club is. 

For example, your MSN contacts were too selective of a group, whereas Facebook groups are not selective enough. Business schools are all about the brand value implied by selectivity. Reddit's light moderation results in some amount of selectivity. On average you get more professional value from your school network compared to your close friend Sunday brunch group, or more informative value from Reddit threads compared to your [180,000 member Facebook group about genuinely stoked goats](https://www.facebook.com/genuinelystokedgoats/ "goat") you don't even remember joining \[7\].

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Community/Community 9.png)

We're seeing curated communities grow in popularity as an attempt at solving that issue. The goal of such communities is to find that optimal spot on the curve to balance value and selectivity. They usually have some form of admission process to screen their members. When they work, there's a feedback loop where having outstanding members generates more interest in the community, which results in more quality members. Especially when the communities are small, there's an incentive for everyone to make things work, so that you can take pride in your membership.

Some examples of such communities are:

- [Renaissance Collective](https://www.renaissancecollective.co/for-smart-generalists "Renco") which is a community of operators who are "smart generalists"
- [On Deck](https://www.beondeck.com/ "On Deck") which is "where top talent goes to explore what's next"
- [The Progress Studies slack group](https://patrickcollison.com/progress "Progress") for people interested in "the science of progress"
- [Soho House](https://www.sohohouse.com/about "Soho") whose members are "like-minded people with creative souls"
- [The Interintellect](https://www.interintellect.com/ "inter") which is "building a new way to be a prolific and successful intellectual in the 21st century"

On the company level, **building a community is similar to owning your audience,** something we'll come back to later while discussing newsletters and media. It's usually more expensive to acquire a new customer than sell to an existing one, so building a more loyal fanbase directly affects business growth. [Gavin Baker elaborates on loyalty here](https://medium.com/@gavin_baker/scale-and-loyalty-are-more-important-online-than-offline-which-drives-much-of-the-winner-take-992345be93a9 "Loyalty"), and the main takeaway is that the avoidance of customer acquisition costs through customer loyalty give your business a competitive advantage.

One industry that understands this well is the gaming market. Look to how the companies behind Minecraft, Fortnite, or Roblox have locked in their target customers. [Minecraft has 126mm monthly active users](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21262045/minecraft-sales-monthly-players-statistics-youtube "Minecraft"). [Fortnite is still breaking attendance records for its in game concerts](https://www.gamesradar.com/how-many-people-play-fortnite/ "Fortnite"). [Roblox makes >$1bn in rev and is played by half of all children in the US](https://www.thegamer.com/roblox-played-by-most-american-kids/ "Roblox"). In many of these games, people are heading there because their friends are there. They're the new MSN of 2020 \[8\].

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Community/Community 10.png)

Besides value and selectivity, the last factor I'd think about for virtual groups is **growth potential.** Growth usually comes at the expense of selectivity; as the group grows the value added by the next member is lower on average. For example, [when I wrote about Cosign,](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/would-you-cosign-your-ai-chess-partner "cosign") I was concerned about expansion.

There are ways around this, such as doing batch intakes on a periodic basis. That's the model that colleges, startup accelerators, or online course communities take. Another option is to have a fixed number of spots, and only admit new people once someone leaves. For groups that are intended to be evergreen, such as RenCo or The Interintellect, it'll be interesting to see how they manage growth vs other competing factors.

In summary, groups have been and always will be powerful, though the way they are organised changes with the times. If you're not already building or part of a community, it's worth exploring what's out there. If you are interested in building a community and don't know where to begin, [there's also a community for that.](https://www.community.club/ "club") 

Additionally, to put money where my mouth is, I'm considering setting up a community for Avoid Boring People - I'll be sending a survey next month, but in the meantime let me know if it's something you'd be interested in by replying to this email.

#### 2. Media

In the world of content, individuals are choosing the opportunity to influence and earn by themselves. By going independent, they're giving up some stability and support from the platform, in exchange for higher reward and responsibility. I want to focus on the email newsletter industry today, although this trend isn't unique to it - youtube, twitch, tiktok, tencent video, onlyfans are all examples of the individual finding success today by [unbundling the value of their personal content.](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling "bundle")

Let's look at:

- What's driving the trend of newsletter creation
- What the business model and economics could be for a newsletter at scale
- What the future of media could look like

##### Newsletters driven by cost, convenience, and control

Li Jin has written about the passion economy [here](https://li-jin.co/2019/10/22/the-passion-economy-and-the-future-of-work/ "Li Jin"), proposing that:

> Whereas previously, the biggest online labor marketplaces flattened the individuality of workers, new platforms allow anyone to monetize unique skills. Gig work isn’t going anywhere—but there are now more ways to capitalize on creativity. Users can now build audiences at scale and turn their passions into livelihoods, whether that’s playing video games or producing video content. This has huge implications for entrepreneurship and what we’ll think of as a “job” in the future.

All business models can be simplified as:

1. Find people
2. Sell them stuff \[9\]

When it's costly for a single business to do either of those, you get companies coming in to fill the gap. Call these aggregators, platforms, middlemen, bundlers, distributors, whatever. What they're doing is recognising that there's a need for someone to spread a large fixed cost over a large customer base.  

**The internet has drastically decreased the cost of both of those tasks,** and looks likely to continue doing so. It's possible for someone to find customers and fulfil their orders while keeping a low fixed cost base. Lowering the barrier to entry tautologically means you get more entrants.

Using newsletters as an example, it's easier to get readers now than 20 years ago. I get random reader emails from people in places and life situations that I'd not have imagined (keep them coming!), let alone begin targeting my marketing efforts at. And when I want to send a newsletter issue, I also pay a much lower fee than if everything was in print. 

In addition to a decrease in cost, an **increase in convenience** has also facilitated the newsletter trend. I could be mistaken, but I feel the newsletter boom started picking up after [substack announced their funding round.](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/16/substack-series-a/ "substack") What substack did was make it way easier to get started, as I outlined in an [older post](https://www.leonlinsx.com/substack/ "substack"). By worrying less about whatever a [cname record](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/differences-a-cname-records/ "cname") is and instead being able to start writing immediately, substack enticed many people to try it out.

Another important thing newsletters enable is **increased control of your audience**; [a direct relationship with readers.](https://www.protocol.com/substack-ceo-newsletter-obsession "substack") For now, email is still in this sweet spot where people will open and check the stuff they get. Compare this to snail mail, where half the time I'm getting an ad to sell the apartment I'm renting, or to any feed-based content platform, where half the time I'm seeing something supposedly popular but I don't care about. Owning an audience is like having your own community to care for.

One point of nuance to the above. I said that the cost of acquiring an audience was low, and that the convenience of sending a newsletter is high. However, it is not convenient to acquire an audience. Building a readership base takes work, [unless you're Bella Thorne and trying to scam sex workers.](https://reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/comments/ikotvd/can_celebs_be_choosing_beggars_edited_for_sub/ "Bella") Some creators spend more than half their time marketing their work vs actually creating content. That increased friction - of you having to get a reader, and a reader having to give you their email - is what actually deepens the sense of relationship. I signed up for this, therefore it must be good and I should read it. Since you've frontloaded your customer acquisition cost (and effort), selling to that group becomes much easier down the line.

##### Individual newsletters at scale seem likely to be $100k businesses

Let's split the world of content into 3 main types, since I can't remember more than 3 things at a time:

1. To entertain
2. To educate
3. To engender emotion

If you're a newsletter writer, you're aiming for your own unique mix of the three. Where you end up with influences your pricing. [Byrne Hobart has written about newsletter pricing before](https://diff.substack.com/p/whats-next-for-the-diff "Diff"), and it boils down to: Is this something you can and would expense on a corporate card?

If the newsletter can educate me to be better at my job and earn more \[10\], you can jack up pricing. If it's more for personal entertainment or emotion, it's harder to do so. I could try, but it's a near impossibility for me to make you feel the same way after reading my writing vs [after watching Arrival.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8z720w/movies_that_destroy_you_emotionally/ "Arrival")

### Footnotes

1. [Aloette](https://aloetterestaurant.com/ "Aloette") for the curious.
2. To be clear, I'm not making the case that Covid *caused* these trends. It may have accelerated some, and had no effect on others. I'm more trying to explore the general theme of community from different interpretations
3. Having watched this for the first time, I'm surprised by how many of its great episodes still hold up. Also, the Spike/Buffy relationship is really creepy both ways man.
4. Having Q&A means you'll need to be more effective at moderating, which isn't that big a deal most of the time.
5. That was the primary reason I didn't get a ticket for Tomorrowland, since I didn't see the value add personally.
6. For example, tipping or subscribing to live streamers has been a large market for China streamers, and took off later for Western ones
7. Note that I'm not saying your personal friendships have no value; this is more from a "professional" point of view.
8. I haven't read either yet, but there's a detailed Matthew Ball piece on gaming [here](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/digitalthemeparkplatforms "ball") and a Jon Lai one [here](https://a16z.com/2020/09/01/tabletop-games-go-digital/ "Jon")
9. Ideally at a profit, though selling stuff for less than it's worth seems to be all the rage these days. You make it up with volume I suppose...
10. I thought about putting "earn" as the fourth factor, but I'll group it under the larger bucket of education to keep the Whole E Trinity.
