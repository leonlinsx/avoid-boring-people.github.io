I used to travel to Toronto for work.

There was a restaurant I liked to visit, with excellent food, drinks, and staff \[1\]. I'd half hoped to become a regular there, tasting every item on the menu and swapping cocktail chit chat with the bartenders.

No more.

I used to host cocktail nights.

I'd invite guests to my apartment while I served drinks, shaken or stirred. Sometimes we even did cocktail lessons. It'd turned into a sustainable, recurring affair where I could catch up with old friends or make new ones.

No more.

I used to do monthly group dinners.

We'd pick a restaurant in Manhattan, reserve a date weeks in advance, and then share food and stories. Group dinners are great; they mean more meals to try.

I've been lucky this year, all things considered. I'm still alive, still healthy, still have a job. No major losses. 

And yet, there is this foreboding feeling that something has disappeared, and I don't think it's just me. That gym buddy you've never spoken to but always comes at the same time you do, the bartender you thought was flirting with you but is just being friendly, or the friend that you're ok talking to once a quarter but no more than that; turns out they all contributed in some small way to the sense of community you felt in your city.

That's gone for now, and people have reacted in different ways. Some search for community via virtual avenues, others are trying to go without.

Today I want to explore that theme, of community and individuality, from a few different perspectives. We'll first look at the events and groups that have adapted for the individual seeking community. Then, we'll look at the rise of the individual in media, particularly the newsletter business. We'll end off with an overview of the individual in investing, particularly solo venture capitalists \[2\].

#### 1. Events

If you're like me, your post-lockdown days probably look like a mixture of  

#### 2. Media

In the world of content, individuals are choosing the opportunity to influence and earn by themselves. By going independent, they're giving up some stability and support from the platform, in exchange for higher reward and responsibility. I want to focus on the newsletter industry today, although this trend isn't unique to it - youtube, twitch, tiktok, tencent video, onlyfans are all examples of the individual finding success today by [unbundling their personal value.](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling "bundle")

These are the questions I'm interested in:

- What's driving the trend of newsletter creation?
- What the business model and economics could be for a newsletter at scale
- What the future of media could look like



Distribution cost vs acquisition

long goodbye

looking for community - events, groups, zooms

Comunity

I write for the Avoid Boring People community; sometimes people even read 

I can't count above three so let's leave it at that.

2. To be clear, I'm not making the case that Covid *caused* these trends. It may have accelerated some, and had no effect on others. I'm more trying to explore the general theme of community from different interpretations
