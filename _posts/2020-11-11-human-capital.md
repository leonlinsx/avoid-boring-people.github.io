## Main

We discussed middlemen in financial capital last week. This week, let's look at human capital. 

In the paper [Are Inventors or Firms the Engines of Innovation?](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3081933 "paper") Ajay Bhaskarabhatla, Luis Cabral, Deepak Hegde, and Thomas Peeters look into whether we should credit humans or companies more for innovations. If you think about companies as performing a middleman role of "matching people together," you might wonder who deserves more merit.

> Indeed, if the ability to invent rests with firm-specific structure, culture, and routines that are hard to transfer across organizational boundaries, then inventors may be substitutable, and firms should develop capabilities that enhance innovation. If, on the other hand, human capital is critical for innovation, then firms’ innovativeness will depend on their ability to screen, attract and retain talented workers. 

> inventor-specific fixed effects explain 18-37 percent of the observed variance in inventors’ patenting performance. In contrast, only 2-7 percent of the overall variance in inventor productivity is explained by firm fixed effects. The observed firm-level variables, such as age, size, patent stock and R&D intensity, explain another 1 to 8 percent of the overall variance. These results suggest inventor-specific human capital explains much of the variance in inventor output

> low human capital inventors match with high innovation capability firms. The idea is that the innovation boost provided by firms with high innovation capabilities is particularly valuable for low human capital inventors, who are willing to accept lower wages for the “amenity” of higher innovation rates. 

> By contrast, high human capital inventors cluster at firms with low innovation capabilities. Intuitively, these inventors have less to gain from their employer’s innovation capabilities, placing a relatively greater weight on their financial compensation

## Footnotes

1. "We tackle these challenges by assembling data on all U.S. patents granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between 1973 and 2010. Patents record the identity of their inventors and firm-assignees, allowing us to construct a 37-year panel of each patenting firm’s and patenting inventor’s annual patenting output—our proxy for inventive performance." 
2. "To tease apart the relative contributions of firms and inventors for innovation, we apply the identification strategy of Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) (henceforth AKM). This strategy requires that we use a subsample of inventors who work at firms connected to one another by moving inventors." 
3. "However, a critical assumption of our model is that inventors care about wages as well as the immediate outcome of their efforts, namely innovation
output. Inventors may have intrinsic preferences over innovation output (e.g., publications or patents, as in Stern 2004) or value outputs as a signal of their productivity to labor markets (Melero, Palomeras and Wehrheim 2019; Kline et al 2019). Moreover, we assume that inventors’ marginal utility of innovation output is diminishing: an additional patent matters more for an inventor with fewer patents than for an inventor with more patents under her belt. Specifically, we assume that the marginal utility of innovation declines at a higher rate than a logarithmic function"
