2. [“We’re told that science self-corrects, but what the candidate-gene literature demonstrates is that it often self-corrects very slowly, and very wastefully, even when the writing has been on the wall for a very long time,”](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/waste-1000-studies/589684/ "waste") More people are focused on replicability issues in scientific fields now, which is a good thing. 
3. ["But every trend has a shelf life, and as quickly as Instagram ushered in pink walls and pastel macaroons, it’s now turning on them."](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/04/influencers-are-abandoning-instagram-look/587803/ "insta") Well there goes my hope of becoming insta-famous
4. ["Another strategy, one we term “manclusion,” involves including men in meetings simply to induce better behavior from the men on the other side of the table."](http://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2019/06/06/venture-bearding/ "venture bearding")
5. [And on the opposite end, stories from Female to Male transgender people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2018/07/20/feature/crossing-the-divide-do-men-really-have-it-easier-these-transgender-guys-found-the-truth-was-more-complex/?utm_term=.95366da87114 "FTM") 
  
  > "What continues to strike me is the significant reduction in friendliness and kindness now extended to me in public spaces. It now feels as though I am on my own"

6. [Violent protests increased support for liberal policy due to greater mobilisation of voters](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/renos/files/enoskaufmansands.pdf "violent")
7. [Reconstructing facial images based on voice](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09773.pdf "face"). Note that the idea wasn't to recover an exact image, but common visual features that connected with speech attributes. 
8. [Celebrity cameos for sale.](https://www.cameo.com/faq "cameo") Would be a great Xmas present if anyone got me a Jenna Coleman one...just saying
