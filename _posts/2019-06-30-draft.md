**Annotated guide to SEC vs Kik**

[Katherine Wu](https://www.katherinewu.me/writings/2019/6/4/annotated-guide-to-the-secs-complaint-against-kik "Kat") published a detailed annotation of her thoughts on the SEC vs KiK complaint [here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ac136ed12b13f7c187bdf21/t/5cf6b874d6c27c00017d2f14/1559672949112/SEC+sues+Kik.pdf "pdf"). If you're interested in crypto I recommend reading her full notes. Quotes below are from the SEC; comments from Katherine:

> However, Kik’s offer and sale of Kin was not registered with the SEC, and investors did not receive the disclosures required by the federal securities 

issue: kin = unregistered security

> it is unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to sell securities in interstate commerce.

this puts it under federal jurisdiction

> In late 2016 and early 2017, Kik faced a crisis.  Fewer and fewer people were using Kik Messenger.  The company expected to run out of cash to fund its operations by the end of 2017, but its revenues were insignificant, and executives had no realistic plan to increase revenues through its existing operations.  In late 2016 and early 2017, Kik hired an investment bank to try to sell itself to a larger technology company, but no one was interested. 

> Faced with a shrinking financial “runway,” Kik decided to “pivot” to an entirely different business and attempt what a board member called a “hail Mary pass”:  Kik would offer and sell one trillion digital tokens in return for cash to fund company operations and a speculative new venture.

> And, Kik described Kin as an opportunity for both Kik and early Kin investors to “make a ton of money.”

oof

> Even prior to the DAO Report, however, Kik had been informed by one of its consultants that the Kin offering was, potentially, an offering of securities that needed to be registered with the SEC and that “unregistered public securities offerings are not 
legal in the U.S.”

This is their way of saying "Kik knew better"

> The SEC seeks a final judgment: (a) permanently enjoining Kik from engaging in acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein; (b) ordering Kik to disgorge its ill-gotten gains and to pay prejudgment interest thereon; and (c) imposing civil money penalties on Kik pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act \[15 U.S.C § 77t(d)\].

Here is what the SEC wants, the penalty amount will be decided by the jury

> Investors’ purchases of Kin were an investment of money, in a common enterprise, with an expectation of profits for both Kik and the offerees, derived primarily from the future efforts of Kik and others to build the Kin Ecosystem and drive demand for Kin.  Consequently, Kik’s offer and sale of Kin in 2017 was an offer and sale of securities 

**Career advice**

I came across [an old post by Elizabeth Yin](https://elizabethyin.com/2015/11/25/6-things-ive-learned-about-careers-in-the-last-decade/ "elizabeth"), but the career/life advice is timeless:

> tl;dr Believe in your fucking self.  That’s it.  That’s all that matters.  Everything else stems from this

> \1. Failure opens doors to success. When one door closes, you’re forced to find another one to open, and that one could be better.

There's truth to the cliche 'if you're not failing you're not trying hard enough'. Failure is awful. We don't wake up in the morning and go 'I'm thankful for my spouse and my kids and the chance to fail horribly at everything I do today'. But it's necessary as long as we're pushing ourselves. After a failure, we can keep trying, give up and try something different, or give up entirely. If you've succeeded at something failed at before, good for you. If you've realised the prestigious career you went into 'because everyone else was doing so' isn't working out, that's good to know sooner rather than later \[9\]. If you want to get better at a sport but never practiced since that one failure, that's on you.   

It's still going to suck. Believing in yourself even while everything seems to be crumbling will be hard, and sometimes impossible. And I say this as someone who's experienced one of my life's greatest failures in the past year. It's tough to get over, and maybe we never do. But we have to move on, if only a bit at a time. If we quit entirely, we lose by default. Quitting entirely is the comfortable and easy way out, but also the least rewarding. *Know the game you're playing for, and stay in the game.* 

> \2. Don’t worry about what other people think. Worrying about what other people think prevents you from taking risks and, by definition, limits your reward.

I broadly agree with this. Most people care too much about how their friends, their friends' friends, or that random cute stranger at the rock climbing wall on Saturdays is perceiving them. [Group consensus](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/after-service/201705/the-science-behind-why-people-follow-the-crowd "social psych") is a thing after all, and usually comes with a negative connotation. We could use more self-assurance and less worrying about the subjective opinions of others.

However, this can also swing to the extreme. There's plenty of examples in which a confident leader leads a country or company into ruin. I think the balance here is having a small number of trusted advisors that you can reach out to for unbiased help, and knowing when their advice is applicable or lacking full context.

> \3. Persistence trumps all.  Anything worth doing is hard.  Just keep going.

Similar to the first point above. Most things aren't easy, even if you have a passion for it \[10\]. But if you don't put in the work to get better you can only blame yourself

> \4. Optimize for one thing.  What you optimize for may change over time, but you can only optimize for one thing at a time.

I don't know how I feel about this. There's more than one thing I care deeply about, and I think that's likely the case for most people. Maybe they don't have to all be in conflict, though I see her point. I'd also advise that going too far in one pursuit when younger could also lead to significant setbacks when you're older, e.g. if you put off saving in tax-deferred accounts to spend on enjoying life

> \5. Find feedback buried in a haystack and improve yourself.

Similar to what I wrote about in the second point, so I'd say we're aligned on this. Getting constructive feedback sucks. Who wants to be told about where they're a failure at? However, even we feel the feedback we've received is inaccurate, we need to realise that that is how our critic views us. It's then up to us to decide if it's worth fixing that perceived flaw or not

> \6. Keep perspective.  Time is actually your most important commodity, not money.  You don’t know how much more time you have, and every day that passes, it becomes even more valuable.

I would give multiple kidneys to be 18 again. And I'm sure I'd feel even more strongly about that the older I get. But time spent regretting the past is time wasted. Live in the now or for the future. Don't waste too much time.
