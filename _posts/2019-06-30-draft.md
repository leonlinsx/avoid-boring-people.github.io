2. [“We’re told that science self-corrects, but what the candidate-gene literature demonstrates is that it often self-corrects very slowly, and very wastefully, even when the writing has been on the wall for a very long time,”](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/waste-1000-studies/589684/ "waste") More people are focused on replicability issues in scientific fields now, which is a good thing.

4. ["Another strategy, one we term “manclusion,” involves including men in meetings simply to induce better behavior from the men on the other side of the table."] Is this real? (http://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2019/06/06/venture-bearding/ "venture bearding") 
5. [Celebrity cameos for sale.](https://www.cameo.com/faq "cameo") Would be a great Xmas present if anyone got me a Jenna Coleman one...just saying
6. [Violent protests increased support for liberal policy due to greater mobilisation of voters](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/renos/files/enoskaufmansands.pdf "violent")
