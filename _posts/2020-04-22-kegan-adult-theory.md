**Main**

I've briefly mentioned Robert Kegan's theory of adult development before [here](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/improving-forecasts-and-incentivising "post"), and recently I found [an online Stanford post](https://tomprof.stanford.edu/posting/1110 "Stanford") that discusses the concept in more detail than what I'd seen on wiki \[1\]. Kegan's theory describes how we grow and become more complex as we age \[2\]; highlights from the article below:

Kegan proposed that growth of an individual moves through five stages. He uses different terms for these, depending on the year he writes about them \[3\], and I'll use "stage of development" for the rest of this post for consistency. The process of moving from one stage to another can be painful. The five stages he proposes are:

1. I believe someone posted about it on twitter, but can't find the original tweet. If this was you, lmk and I can credit accordingly.
2. "Kegan (Robert) introduced his theory of self-evolution in 1982 in his book, The Evolving Self. In his later book, In over Our Heads: The Mental Demands of Modern Life (1994), he presented a revised version of his theory and further discussion of the implications of his work for society." He was influenced by Piaget and Kernberg.
3. "Kegan referred to as stages of development in 1982, orders of consciousness in 1994, and forms of mind in 2000"
