## Main

We started out the month [looking at art](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/manet-and-modernity "art"), and there's a reason for that. Art is high skill, low luck. While it's possible to create great art without much skill, most art is crafted intentionally. Since you start from scratch, every element is there for a reason. We saw this in Manet's "unpolished" depiction of modern life, Dominique-Ingres' "unrealistic" body shape, and Picasso's "ugly" drawings, where weird features were the point of the painting. Throughout these, the artists followed their own deliberate process to get consistent results.

Another thing on my mind this year was process improvement, or "getting better at getting better." Here's why:

1. We can consider most activities as being a mix of skill and luck. 
2. Using Annie Duke's framework of ["Is is possible to deliberately lose at this game,"](https://www.annieduke.com/poker-legend-annie-duke-on-making-smarter-decisions/ "Duke") we can roughly rank games in terms of high vs low skill
3. If we're looking to win more often (not always the case \[1\]), we should look for games with high skill that we also believe we can improve in
4. Improving at a skill is not just a matter of practicing, but practicing deliberately. That means being able to take a step back and look at your entire process, identify weak points, and experiment with new ideas

Getting better at something - that's a process.

Getting better at getting better - that's one more layer of abstraction and can be harder to think about, but is also a process in itself.

What makes things even harder is that processes are intangible. You can depict them in some flowchart, but most people prefer judging the visual outcome over the invisible process. Telling someone "I made $1mm" sounds better than "I improved my prioritisation criteria so that I only took high expected value clients." We're judged by key performance indicators, not key process indicators.

And yet, over the long run process wins out. Luck will average out \[2\], and you're left with the output of your process and skill. If your process is bad on average, you will be bad on average. 

We've seen suggestions on how to improve processes [in an older article this year](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/often-overlooked-process-improvement "process"), and my practical takeaways are:

### 1. Knowing what you're doing

Starting from the basics, you need to be able to diagram all your steps. If you don't even know what you're doing you can't consciously choose to work on anything.

For example, if you want to be a better investor, you need to note down all the steps involved from your idea generation to exit trade. 

### 2. Knowing why you're doing it

The idea behind [Chesterton's Fence](https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/ "Fence") is that if we see an object and don't understand its purpose, we should acquire that understanding before removing it. 

Similarly, if we think back to making art, we should also understand why we're including something onto our canvas.

To continue the investing example, if you've always included "due diligence call with someone in industry" as part of your process, it's worth thinking about why you do so.

### 3. Knowing what you're missing

People argue about the importance of theory vs practical all the time, and it's usually an unproductive discussion. More hands on experience will make you better. More theoretical knowledge will also make you better. If you don't practice you can't get better. If you don't know the rationale behind why you're practicing, your progress will be slow or nonexistent; you'll plateau without knowing what's holding you back.

For the investor, you'll never make money if all you do is read finance theory and don't actually put money in the market. However, if you don't understand how professional investing works and the informational edge that institutions have, you'll also get blown up \[3\]. 

### 4. Reflect on your steps



### 5. Adjust and retry

## Footnotes

1. There are many games we play just for fun, and getting too good at them vs your playmates will make the game unfun. 
2. If you're lucky all the time, I'd argue that's not luck anymore but something systemic. It's like how pretty people say everyone's always friendly to them and how they're so lucky that nice girl at the coffeeshop gives them a free donut everytime.
3. Well in this market you'll probably become a billionaire and retire while laughing at my advice...
