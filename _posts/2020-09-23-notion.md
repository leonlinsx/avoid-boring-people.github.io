## Notion workspace for your workplace

In the movie [Inception by Christopher Nolan,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception "Inception") the main characters wander through nested layers of dreams to carry out a task. Their actions within that layer affect the layer itself, and also the layers above or below it. Sometimes, it can be hard to remember which layer you're in.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/notion/Notion 5.png)

I want you to keep that framework in mind - **of layers, interaction within layers, and interaction among the layers.** We'll come back to it shortly \[1\].

Recently, productivity startups like Notion, Coda, Roam have all raised rounds at high valuations for their size. [The hustle has Notion at a $2bn valuation, Coda at $600mm, and Roam at $200mm](https://thehustle.co/09142020-roam-research/ "Hustle"). Considering how young these companies are \[2\], those are optimistic venture evaluations of the potential for such companies.

Today I want to look closer at [Notion](https://www.notion.so/ "Notion"). We'll go over \[3\]:

1. What Notion's purpose is
2. Walkthrough of sample features
3. Suggestions for the Notion team

So that at the end of this, you'll have an idea of why these startups exist, what they look like, and how they might change for the future.

Let's get started.

## Notion is a visual based approach to information organisation and collaboration

To better understand Notion, we need to get more context on the history of our interaction with information, and the evolution of computing.

We can crudely think of humans as a function. We take data as input, process it, and give some response as output. That output data then goes on to influence others who themselves process it and react accordingly.

We used to store data physically, and you'd have to go visit a library or professional in person to get some scroll of truth telling you [how likely Jack Sparrow would have visited Singapore](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gd7cww/in_pirates_of_carribbean_jack_sparrow_says_youve/ "Reddit") \[4\]. 

With computers, we've moved to storing data digitally, even allowing multiple collaborators on a document at the same time. **We're no longer bound by the physical location of the data or person, which opens up opportunities to interact with information on a global scale.** Before, there was little chance I could work with someone in Uganda, given the speed of information transfer. Now, not only can we work together, we can even work on the same document simultaneously. 

It took a while to get here though, as it required changes in mindset, technology, and design to enable our current work habits. 

One big change was the **[graphical user interface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=39&v=BFlop4sP8Os&feature=emb_title "GUI").** Before this, people were interacting with computers via a command line interface, much like the below. 

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/notion/Notion 5.png)

As you can see, it's not the most intuitive way to work with a computer. I'll claim I left that mistake in there as a teachable moment; truth is I forgot the proper syntax. Command line interaction may be powerful, but poses a high barrier to entry for most users. By re-designing usage around a visual experience, [Apple achieved a breakthrough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_graphical_user_interface "Apple") in making computing mass market \[5\]. Computing progress would have been slowed significantly if we still worked only in command line.

A second big change was the internet, coming in two waves. Before this, people stored work on physical media such as floppy disks \[6\]. If you wanted to share something, you'd still have to transport your temporary storage physically to the other person.

Email helped change that, by slowly removing the need for hardware and increasing the convenience and speed of data transfer. Rather than send you one thumb drive with a finalised edited version of your proposal, your boss can now send ten separate unlinked emails giving you comments on footnote size formatting. 

In the last 10 years, the increased bandwidth of the internet has also enabled our **move to the cloud.** Instead of emailing back and forth, everyone can now collaborate in real time on the same document, further increasing convenience and reducing version control issues. Rather than losing track of the latest version of your doc, now everyone can comment together on the same page to give you more work.

First we need to 

Productivity startups have raised 

physical world - duplicate copy to be in different places. 

Communicate, on the same page. Literally. 

publicly editable contact me page

how much of the work day spent? 

from command line to gui

software word, docs, 

bundle all that, without OS

what does this open up?

the key is what notion allows you to create, what templates and additional control do you get?

notion champions, notion community, notion certificates, training, pros, educations, seminars

need to look at the templates to get an idea

template competition

invest in bloggers

functionality

drag and drop blocks

the prestige, nolan, inception, notion

core functions - collaboration, 

notion still at information organisation stage

select multiple? 

Far fetched ideas

1. email
2. sql
3. jupyter

tables

Problems

1. Click outside of area
2. Mobile app sign up

Suggestions 

1. email replacement?


## Footnotes

1. I'll admit that half the reason I'm making this reference is so I can insert a Marion Cotillard poster, but you'll see later that the analogy actually makes sense. Well, at least to me.
2. I have [Notion founded in 2013,](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/notion-so "Notion") [Coda in 2014](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coda-add7 "Coda"), and [Roam in 2017](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/343764-28#funding "Roam"), but have also heard early beta versions launched before those dates.
3. I'm more comfortable analysing internet businesses vs software, but let's see where this takes us. As always, feel free to comment, especially if you disagree.
4. The top comment says not likely, fwiw.
5. Yes, they stole the idea from Xerox; I'll give credit to them here for the execution of the idea
6. I oddly remember being so proud of this [zip drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_drive "zip") that my dad gave me because it was newer, fancier, and had **more storage** than other people.
