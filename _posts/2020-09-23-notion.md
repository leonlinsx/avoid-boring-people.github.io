## Notion workspace for your workplace

In the movie [Inception by Christopher Nolan,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception "Inception") the main characters wander through nested layers of dreams to carry out a task. Their actions within that layer affect the layer itself, and also the layers above or below it. Sometimes, it can be hard to remember which layer you're in.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/notion/Notion 5.png)

I want you to keep that framework in mind - **of layers, interaction within layers, and interaction among the layers.** We'll come back to it shortly \[1\].

Recently, productivity startups like Notion, Coda, Roam have all raised rounds at high valuations for their size. [The hustle has Notion at a $2bn valuation, Coda at $600mm, and Roam at $200mm](https://thehustle.co/09142020-roam-research/ "Hustle"). Considering how young these companies are \[2\], those are optimistic venture evaluations of the potential for such companies.

Today I want to look closer at [Notion](https://www.notion.so/ "Notion"). We'll go over \[3\]:

1. What Notion's purpose is
2. Walkthrough of sample features
3. Suggestions for the Notion team

So that at the end of this, you'll have an idea of why these startups exist, what they look like, and how they might change for the future.

Let's get started.

## Notion is a visual based approach to information organisation and collaboration

To better understand Notion, we need to get more context on the history of our interaction with information, and the evolution of computing.

We can crudely think of humans as a function. We take data as input, process it, and give some response as output. That output data then goes on to influence others who themselves process it and react accordingly.

We used to store data physically, and you'd have to go visit a library or professional in person to get some scroll of truth telling you [how likely Jack Sparrow would have visited Singapore](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gd7cww/in_pirates_of_carribbean_jack_sparrow_says_youve/ "Reddit") \[4\]. 

With computers, we've moved to storing data digitally, even allowing multiple collaborators on a document at the same time. **We're no longer bound by the physical location of the data or person, which opens up opportunities to interact with information on a global scale.** Before, there was little chance I could work with someone in Uganda, given the speed of information transfer. Now, not only can we work together, we can even work on the same document simultaneously. 

It took a while to get here though, as it required changes in mindset, technology, and design to enable our current work habits. 

One big change was the **[graphical user interface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=39&v=BFlop4sP8Os&feature=emb_title "GUI").** Before this, people were interacting with computers via a command line interface, much like the below. 

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/notion/Notion 6.png)

As you can see, it's not the most intuitive way to work with a computer. I'll claim I left that mistake in there as a teachable moment; truth is I forgot the proper syntax. Command line interaction may be powerful, but poses a high barrier to entry for most users. By re-designing usage around a visual experience, [Apple achieved a breakthrough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_graphical_user_interface "Apple") in making computing mass market \[5\]. Computing progress would have been slowed significantly if we still worked only in command line.

A second big change was the internet, coming in two waves. Before this, people stored work on physical media such as floppy disks \[6\]. If you wanted to share something, you'd still have to transport your temporary storage physically to the other person.

Email helped change that, by slowly removing the need for hardware and increasing the convenience and speed of data transfer. Rather than send you one thumb drive with a finalised edited version of your proposal, your boss can now send ten separate unlinked emails giving you comments on footnote size formatting. 

In the last 10 years, the increased bandwidth of the internet has also enabled our **move to the cloud.** Instead of emailing back and forth, everyone can now collaborate in real time on the same document, further increasing convenience and reducing version control issues. I can now sit in my pajamas watching [Dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_(TV_series) "Dark") while half-heartedly replying to comments on a google doc. Not that I would, of course.

The internet and cloud provided the foundation for the growth of all the [Software as a Service (SaaS)](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/saas-vs-paas-vs-iaas-whats-the-difference-and-how-to-choose/ "SaaS") businesses we see today. By taking it as a given that someone else will provide the infrastructure (IaaS) or platform (PaaS) required to support them, software companies can concentrate on addressing a specific niche segment.

With the [low cost of capital](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/cost-of-capital-in-the-21st-century "low"), high potential margins, and sticky revenue base, it's no wonder we've seen so many software companies try to digitalise a function that used to be physical. We have company wikis replacing compendiums, kanban boards replacing post it notes, and note taking apps replacing journals.

This is where Notion comes in. **[Notion was to be your all-in-one workspace,](https://www.notion.so/product "Notion")** being the main place you write, plan, and organise your work. All of that separate software we just mentioned? Notion wants to bundle them all, and give you one consistent user experience with enough flexibility to cater to most of your tasks.  

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/notion/Notion 7.png)

Want a company wiki? You can create it in Notion.

Want a task board? You can create it in Notion.

Want a note taking page? You get the idea.

This is already a large, feasible market to serve, but let's speculate on Notion's potential, and how it can grow even further. It's time to bring in the Inception analogy from the beginning, and apply it to how data layers exist in a company.

A company has to gather and store data. We'll call this the **data storage layer,** and group all the infrastructure related companies together here for simplicity. For example, if you're a retailer, you're storing transaction records so that you can fulfil the orders later, and you'd use AWS to do so \[7\].

A company also has to analyse the data they've gathered. We'll call this the **data analysis layer,** and group all the tools that can interact with databases to do calculations here. For example, you might want to find out how many customers you got this month, and you'd use SQL to query for that information from your database, and Excel to further refine your research.

A company also has to see the results of that analysis. We'll call this the **data visualisation layer,** and group all the presentation related software here. For example, you could use google slides to present a graph of that data you just pulled, showing that your customers grew 50% week over week. 

There's one last main layer on top of all that. We'll call this the **data sync layer,** and it's where coordination of information takes place. It's no use if your team is the only one that knows how well the business is doing, so you need a way to communicate that information out, and get everyone on the same page. For example, you could send a company wide slack message doing a recap of recent financial metrics.

As data flows through the company in these layers, **it becomes more visual and visible,** resulting in more people being able to interact with it. The tools at the data sync layer, by nature of being the most "end user facing," usually have a more visual oriented design approach, making them easier to pick up for the layman. For example, email is easy, [hadoop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop "hadoop") is hard.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/notion/Notion 8.png)

The framework above gives us a better idea of where Notion's value add is. Notion is currently in the data sync layer, and halfway creeping into the data visualisation layer. I'd previously claimed that this was a big market, so let's justify that before exploring expansion opportunities.


 
**

information costs reduce

like pace layers, fast vs slow

physical world - duplicate copy to be in different places. 

Communicate, on the same page. Literally. 

publicly editable contact me page

how much of the work day spent? 

from command line to gui

software word, docs, 

bundle all that, without OS

interally would think of all of these as failures and opportunities

what does this open up?

the key is what notion allows you to create, what templates and additional control do you get?

notion champions, notion community, notion certificates, training, pros, educations, seminars

need to look at the templates to get an idea

template competition

invest in bloggers

functionality

drag and drop blocks

the prestige, nolan, inception, notion

core functions - collaboration, 

notion still at information organisation stage

select multiple? 

Far fetched ideas

1. email
2. sql
3. jupyter

tables

Problems

1. Click outside of area
2. Mobile app sign up

Suggestions 

1. email replacement?

## Footnotes

1. I'll admit that half the reason I'm making this reference is so I can insert a Marion Cotillard poster, but you'll see later that the analogy actually makes sense. Well, at least to me.
2. I have [Notion founded in 2013,](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/notion-so "Notion") [Coda in 2014](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coda-add7 "Coda"), and [Roam in 2017](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/343764-28#funding "Roam"), but have also heard early beta versions launched before those dates.
3. I'm more comfortable analysing internet businesses vs software, but let's see where this takes us. As always, feel free to comment, especially if you disagree.
4. The top comment says not likely, fwiw.
5. Yes, they stole the idea from Xerox; I'll give credit to them here for the execution of the idea
6. I oddly remember being so proud of this [zip drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_drive "zip") that my dad gave me because it was newer, fancier, and had **more storage** than other people.
7. As with all the other layers, this is a simplified version of reality. Many companies span multiple layers with multiple product offerings.
