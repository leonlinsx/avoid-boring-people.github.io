[Kevin Kelly,](https://kk.org/biography "Kevin") cofounder of Wired magazine, coined the phrase [1,000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/ "1000") many years ago. [Li Jin](https://li.substack.com/people/1021248 "Li") recently built on that idea with her [100 true fans](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/ "100") article. If you haven't read either, the gist is that an achievable amount of loyal fans (100 or 1,000) are enough for creators to make a living. For example, someone who had 1,000 fans paying $100 per year would have enough to get by in most cities; likewise for a creator who had 100 fans paying $1,000 per year. And getting 1,000 fans doesn't sound too far-fetched.

Both of those articles attest that the internet has cut costs for creators, **enabling a long tail of talent to be discovered and supported.** We're all weird, and it's now quicker, cheaper, and easier to find like-minded people producing stuff we want to see. No longer will your virtuosity in acting like a dog remain undiscovered; [it might even make you a six figure income](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/onlyfans-puppy-jenna-phillips-tiktok/ "dog") \[1\].

Whether most creators in this new economy can actually hit that 1,000 true fan goal remains to be seen. We will see many success stories of independent artists, but I feel that we'll fail to see all the people who dropped out along the way. If you've ever tried to grow your follower count on social media, you know that it's more difficult than it looks. In this day, **anybody can be a star, but not everybody will be a star.**

I'll hop on the bandwagon of writers naming frameworks, and call this **the long long tail effect,** seeing as the only precedence for the term [is a children's book.](https://www.amazon.com/Long-Tail-Joy-Cowley/dp/0780248880 "tail") What the long long tail effect says is that long tail is longer and weirder than people expect, even if they already expect the strange. What it implies is that if you want to pick a winner in this new economy, you're better off picking a platform, rather than choosing a creator. Although the chance of success for any single creator is low, the chance of success for the platform consolidating creators is high. 

Hence, rather than discuss depressing dog acting markets, today I want to look at the platforms that power them. In particular, I want to take a closer look at [Cameo,](https://www.cameo.com/ "cameo") a marketplace that provides personalised celebrity video messages. For the cheap price of $30, you can get a custom video message from Kirpa Sudick, Kevin Fortenberry, or 3 (!!) videos from Paris the mini pig \[2\]. People normally get them to wish family and friends happy birthday, graduation, or some other celebration, [to the delight of the recipients.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeYm5TZknsc "reaction")

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Cameo 1.png)

I first mentioned Cameo [about a year ago](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/would-you-buy-the-libra-neopet-kin "Cameo") while trying to guilt people into buying me a Jenna Coleman cameo \[3\], and they're a good example of a beneficiary of the long long tail. The marketplace works because the individual return for these celebrities on their own is low, but the combined return of all of them is high. Paris the mini pig on her own is not likely to make enough for her owner, but combine her with Fiona the Hippo or Lola the Sloth and you might actually have a viable business for the platform providing the service.

Cameo doesn't seem to have a company motto, but what it should be is **"One man's trashy is another man's treasure."** Yes, I know they'll never officially use it, but it comes as a direct consequence of the long long tail. You may not care about contestant #23 on the Bachelor, but someone somewhere out there does. A lot. It would make their day, and they're willing to pay.

This asymmetry in user experience is why Cameo is in such a great spot. [Customer delight?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_delight "customer") [Creating minimum viable happiness?"](https://medium.com/@sarahtavel/the-hierarchy-of-marketplaces-introduction-and-level-1-983995aa218e "Sarah") If you buy Aunt May a cameo from her favourite movie star, that's all she'll talk about for years, and maybe she'll finally stop bugging you about getting married. 

I'd assume that these cameos are simple for celebs to film as well, since all they have to do is read off a script and stare into their phone for a few minutes. Given how easy it is, no wonder so many have joined. [Since the talent also sets the price](http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/January-2020/Cameo-Steven-Galanis/ "price"), that implies that the celebs are charging whatever they feel gives them a balance of bookings and billings. They could raise their rates if they were overbooked, and lower them otherwise. Efficient market in action here.

A quick glance at the site shows prices mostly vary from $30 to $100, which isn't surprising to me. If you've ever been to a comic con before, photo ops or autographs usually go for [somewhere in that range](https://planetcomicon.com/autographphoto-op-price-chart/ "range"), implying there's enough demand at that price point. What Cameo has done is enable the long long tail. Now you can get a comic con substitute anytime, anywhere. [By Grabthar's hammer, what a savings.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgv7U3GYlDY "galaxy quest")

An additional incentive for celebs to be on Cameo is the brand building opportunity for themselves. They not only make money from the video, but remain in the consciousness of their true fans. The biggest fear with fame is to be forgotten, and Cameo curtails that concern. Your fans are incentivised to share your video too, making you more likely to resurge in conversations.

We've established the case for demand, and the case for supply, seeing that there's clear [product market fit.](https://a16z.com/2017/02/18/12-things-about-product-market-fit/ "pmf") What about the economics of the platform itself?

### Shoutouts

1. I spoke to the cofounder of [Baru](https://docsend.com/view/4hb6zzzxz9bd54yb "Baru"), which is a marketplace for custom furniture. They're raising a round if you're interested.

### Footnotes

1. I did warn that it would be weird. Also, it seems like she makes six figures a *month*. 1,000 true onlyfans indeed. Sigh.
2. Nope, I have no idea who any of these people or pets are, but I assume some people do. Paris drives a mean bargain.
3. To no avail, sadly. I'm not picky though, any Dr Who cast member works for me. Still hoping yeah.
