[Kevin Kelly,](https://kk.org/biography "Kevin") cofounder of Wired magazine, coined the phrase [1,000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/ "1000") many years ago. [Li Jin](https://li.substack.com/people/1021248 "Li") recently built on that idea with her [100 true fans](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/ "100") article. If you haven't read either, the gist is that an achievable amount of fans (100 or 1,000) are enough for creators to make a living. For example, someone who had 1,000 fans paying $100 per year would have enough to get by in most cities; likewise for a creator who had 100 fans paying $1,000 per year. 

Both of those articles attest that the internet has cut costs for creators, enabling a long tail of talent to be discovered and supported. 

I first mentioned Cameo [about a year ago](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/would-you-buy-the-libra-neopet-kin "Cameo"), and they're a good example of this long long tail.
