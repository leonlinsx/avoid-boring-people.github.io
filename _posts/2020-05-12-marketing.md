**Main**

I summarised a talk by [Operator Collective](https://operatorcollective.com/about/ "Op Co") \[1\] on operations recently [here](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/how-to-get-back-to-better "coo"), and will be doing another summary today [for a talk they did on marketing.](https://operatorcollective.com/events/ "event") 

Their talk "Marketing and messaging in the time of Coronavirus" included panelists [Janine Pelosi, Zoom CMO](https://twitter.com/janine_pelosi?lang=en "janine") and [Meagen Eisenberg, TripActions CMO](https://twitter.com/meisenberg?s=20 "Meagen"] \[2\]. Notes below will sometimes be paraphrased for clarity, and cover the following topics:

1. 
2. 
3. 



**What has changed in your marketing messaging?**

Meagen
- We've had to take another look at our marketing mix and see what's actually coming in and converting
- In the last two weeks of March and first week of Apr we had dead traffic, decline across the board
- We're now seeing that come back up though (as of May 5)
- We've pivoted to set up content that was informational for our customers e.g. [TripActions Academy](https://tripactions.com/blog/new-tripactions-academy "Trip") \[3\] and webinars. 
- We're finding that people are learning from the above and have found them helpful
- I'm going to twitter more than I have before. Social has become more important for us in engaging customers, and we're getting more of our most qualified leads from social than we used to
- Email channel for leads has been about the same

Janine
- The things you used to look at in terms of months or weekw, you're now looking at on a daily basis
- We have a day 1 mentality all over again at Zoom
- There's been too much change, and there's so many different variables. We need to get to a point where we can stabilise and think about what our new metrics mean for the business
- We're also in a lucky situation that we don't have to make changes in the workforce.
- We've pivoted from one type of marketing to another e.g. from doing events to social media, where we're helping people learn how to use the product
- In terms of helping our workforce pivot in their roles, it starts with who we hire. We hire self starters, and this has helped us with the pivot

**How are you thinking about the next six months?**

Janine 
- We're playing the long game, hoping that a year from now people will remember us as being transparent and owning up when wrong \[4\]
- We have to remain open minded, since we're unsure what even three weeks from now will look like

Meagen
- Our original focus was on connecting both people and businesses
- We've shifted to focus more on businesses as we move forward in the recovery
- We're asking our customers what product features they need. We know we have product market fit and a strong relationship with our customers
- We were spending more of our time on customer acquisition before, and are now trying to get more balanced on other areas

**How do you navigate building a business without being tone deaf?**

Meagen
- It's definitely a risk. We're not hardcore selling right now. 
- You can reduce the risk if you focus on educational material and the value you're providing. Don't stretch the value of what you provide
- Instead, it's the time to build out new products and address things. 
- e.g. we just launched a trains product in europe, and we had a discussion about whether we should talk about it. We still need to educate customers and program managers, and let them know the product will be ready when they get back to traveling

Janine
- It's also an art. What you can do today is different vs 6 weeks ago
- We're focused on supporting users now, not on sales and marketing. All our celebrity shoutouts etc have been organic; we didn't pay for those

**What should CMOs not pay attention to?**

Janine
- In terms of future planning, there are things we can figure out, but you can't just keep to a schedule, you have to be flexible and agile.
- Getting any concrete game plan for next steps now would be a mistake since things are changing so quickly

Meagen 
- I do daily plans, and every week there have been changes to that plan. We have gone from having something as a priority to new priorities often

**What are some things you've put in place?**

Janine 
- We have a daily standup with the exec team, since it's important to ensure that we're getting feedback from the field as we make quick decisions 
- We take a few actions out of that

Meagen  
- Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. You need to be flexible

**What's something you've learnt about crisis management?**

Janine 
- Life isn't fair, not everyone's honest
- If you make right honest decision for good reasons, that will carry you through this
- Surround yourself with the smartest ppl possible. We have a great team at zoom.
- You don't have to do it alone

Meagen  
- You need to put the emotional aspect of crisis aside
- Agree with Janine, surround yourself with the types of people that are better able to deal with crisis than others
- If you can approach problems critically it will help
