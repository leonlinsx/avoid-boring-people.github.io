**Main**

[Operator Collective](https://operatorcollective.com/about/ "Op Co") is a newly founded group for operators from diverse backgrounds to support founders both operationally and financially. Members include C suite people from Stripe, Waymo, Zendesk. 

They recently [held an event](https://operatorcollective.com/events/ "event") on "How do you shift your operations during a crisis?" where they interviewed Michelle Zatlyn, [Cloudflare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare "Cloud") Co-Founder COO and Lexi Reese, [Gusto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gusto_(company) "Gusto") COO \[1\]. Notes below will sometimes be paraphrased for clarity, and covered the following topics:

1. What does a COO actually do?
2. How have you changed operations internally?
3. How are you thinking about the future?
