**Main**

[Operator Collective](https://operatorcollective.com/about/ "Op Co") is a newly founded group for operators from diverse backgrounds to support founders both operationally and financially. Members include C suite people from Stripe, Waymo, Zendesk. They recently [held an event](https://operatorcollective.com/events/ "event") on "How do you shift your operations during a crisis?" where they interviewed Michelle Zatlyn, [Cloudflare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare "Cloud") Co-Founder COO and Lexi Reese, [Gusto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gusto_(company) "Gusto") COO \[1\]. Notes below, with M representing Michelle and L, Lexi. They'll sometimes be paraphrased for clarity.

**What does a COO actually do?**

M 
- I was a founder at Cloudflare \[2\], but I didn't start with the COO title. It was something we grew into. 
- 3 of us started the company, and 2 of us are still running it \[3\]. 
- A different group of people report to me vs the CEO. A lot of the go to market (GTM) functions report to me. Legal, technology, finance to Matthew (Cloudflare CEO)
- The way I think about having a COO role is, if you can bring on people to take on more things than you ever could, you can grow further
- At Cloudflare's stage there's a lot of building to do, it's very messy, and a COO can help with running things if you partner with a person you trust
- But if you look at large companies, not a lot have COOs. So there's some concern about when a company is in its lifecycle. Is it out of build mode and into maintain mode? Would you you still need a COO then?

L 
- Josh, Gusto CEO \[4\], had been given advice that you really need a COO, but need to be intentional about why you're hiring one
- If you're hiring a COO, you need to be explicit about what job needs to be done, that you either have no experience for or no bandwidth 
- I was hired to run customer experience. The challenge we have at Gusto is how to reliably and scalably deliver a customer experience that's unmatched, but do so in a way that's efficient and repeatable. Serving 10k businesses vs 100k is different. 
- I liked starting as the head of UX, since it was a known problem. 
- A COO title can be too vague, with problems not articulated. If you don't have a scoreboard for success in mind, it will be a problem

LL - I've usually thought of the COO role as "how do we make money" and the CEO role as "how do we spend money"; [the CEO's top priority should be capital allocation](https://www.amazon.com/Outsiders-Unconventional-Radically-Rational-Blueprint/dp/1422162672 "Outsiders"). I'm unsure if the point by M on the lack of large company COOs is true, perhaps it is outside of tech? Agree with L on needing to define what success looks like in a role, and that applies at all levels

**What has the impact of Covid been on strategic planning, and have you made any modifications?

M 
- This is not the time for "nice to haves", can only do "must haves". Have put projects on hold.
- We also asked people to flag to their manager if they thought the project they were working on was not a priority for the business, and we saw good outcomes from that
- Right now there are more questions than answers, it's still messy and depends on the company
- We're doing a lot of scenario planning. People are getting a better sense of Q2, and are trying their best to figure out what's going to happen next
- If you're tracking metrics on monthly or quarterly basis, you've got to go to weekly instead, since things change so quickly
- We ask ourselves, "What have you learnt in this week that can change the business going forward"
- We'd always operated quickly, and are operating even more quickly now

L
- It's also interesting to ask what has stayed the same. 
- Our fundamental strategy and mission hasn't changed. Gusto is [a people platform, we deliver prosperity.](https://gusto.com/about "Gusto") 
- Since march, one area we needed people working on first was health and safety for employees
- We have an employee workplace experience workstream, and there we ingest data from local jurisdication and federal law, to set up risk frameworks
- That workstream meant that most of us were already working from home, even before it was mandated, since were taking in all that information and felt that we had to be able to work from home soon
- Providing a service like Gusto is not a nice to have, it's a must have for our customers, so we feel strong in that regard
- Based on what we're reading in our data, we're indeed seeing employees going off payroll and businesses going out of business 
- Right now is the time to focus on organic traffic leads
- And also on the cash we have, cash we need, and make decisions to preserve cash
- For example, taking away perks that weren't mission critical to delivering service
- Need to ask people to rally for this moment

LL - Nothing too surprising here, would say the move towards tracking on a more frequent basis and the emphasis on cash both make sense and are a common trend in companies
