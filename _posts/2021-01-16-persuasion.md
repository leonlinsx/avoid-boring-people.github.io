## Main

When I was in the army, we had a saying: "The Army can't *make* you do anything, but it sure can make you regret not doing so." And it was true; they got two years of obedience out of me during my conscription. Decision making is simple when the alternatives are confinement or jail.

And while I still felt it was a meaningful experience, you can imagine why so many others in my place might have strong feelings against the army. So much so that there's constant pressure in the country to reduce the duration of the stint, the intensity of the exercises, or the selection of the enlistees. A favourite national pastime is to complain about times in the army, right behind complaining about people complaining. 

For an activity meant to be a nation-building exercise, the army causes more negative emotion against the country than most other life events. We did what we were told, but we didn't do it for the right reasons. And that made all the difference in the short term vs long term consequences.

I don't want to make the army the subject of discussion today - it's a special, closed environment and the people are crazy. Instead, let's look at businesses, which are... special, closed environments with crazy people. Hmm.

I've recently been thinking about why so many people complain about work. Most of us work in some larger company, report to some boss, and are accountable for some goal. Where does the short term vs long term tension come in?

First, the amount of autonomy that your boss gives you. Micromanagement works in the short term, since your boss can dictate exactly what they want and how they want it done. In the long term, few people like being being treated like machines, and will start to find their own ways of rebelling \[1\]. Micromanagement is usually the sign of an inexperienced manager who can only see the consequences of the next week's project but not the next year's outcomes.

Second, the amount of turnover that the team experiences. In the short term, it's simpler to treat employees as disposable, since labour is plentiful and there are many more applicants than there are job positions. Think of how investment banking or similar industries churn through batches of analysts every year. You won't see the effect of this immediately, since the basic maintenance work is going to get done just by throwing enough bodies and time at it.

In the long term, the amount of wasted and duplicative training adds up. Something that could have taken an experienced junior a day to do because they've done it before and know who to work with takes a new hire a week to do, at a lower quality too. Since most companies won't hold anyone accountable for this wastage, it'll keep happening over many years.

This problem gets even worse at the senior level. Compare a senior executive at Amazon, [who could have more than two decades of tenure](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/whos-in-charge-at-amazon-moves-on-secretive-s-team-signal-tech-giants-priorities/ "amzn"), against an executive at an investment bank, who would likely have that spread across different banks, if at all. Who will have more context on the issues the company faces, what has been tried before, and what's a waste of time?

Third, the amount of formal training a company will conduct. Most companies treat training as a perfunctory need, figuring that employees will learn most of what they need to know on the job. And while it's true that the majority of

## Footnotes

1. Micromanagement works for tasks that are less complex. For example, if you're manufacturing identical widgets, the process should be the same every time, and this should be managed closely. Most of the projects that we work on are not widget manufacturing
