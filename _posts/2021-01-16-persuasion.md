## Takeaway

Training, retention, and autonomy should be key focus areas for companies but are often neglected due to lack of incentive alignment

## Short vs long term incentive alignment

When I was in the army, we had a saying: "The Army can't *make* you do anything, but it sure can make you regret not doing so." And it was true; they got two years of obedience out of me during my conscription. Decision making is simple when the alternatives are confinement or jail.

And while I still felt it was a meaningful experience, you can imagine why so many others might have strong feelings against the army. So much so that there's constant pressure in the country to reduce the duration of the stint, the intensity of the exercises, or the selection of the enlistees. A favourite national pastime is to complain about times in the army, right behind complaining about people complaining. 

For an activity meant to be a nation-building exercise, the army causes more negative emotion against the country than most other life events. We did what we were told, but we didn't do it for the right reasons. And that made all the difference in the short term vs long term consequences.

I don't want to make the army the subject of discussion today - it's a special, closed environment and the people are crazy. Instead, let's look at businesses, which are... special, closed environments with crazy people. Hmm.

I've recently been thinking about why so many people complain about work:

- What do companies do in the short term that backfires in the long term? 
- What are examples of companies managing well for the long term?
- With so many years of organisational behaviour research behind us, why aren't things better?

One thing I see companies do poorly is **onboarding and training.** It's usually not a priority, and treated more as some perfunctory need that hopefully fades away after the first few weeks. There's an expectations mismatch, since employers don't invest the time to make it helpful, and employees view it as essentially being paid to do nothing. There's also an accountability mismatch since training is run by the HR department and not the department the employees end up working in. 

Short term, this works fine. Employees learn on the job and slowly understand what they need to do. Long term, companies have lost the easiest opportunity to get employees to understand the org culture and build relationships, resulting in a wave of inefficiency every time a new batch of people join. This isn't visible to managers unless they've been through multiple cycles, and there's no incentive to fix it. Companies don't usually have a KPI on how much smarter their employees have gotten over the year.

Which brings me to another thing companies do poorly, **employee retention.** Companies spend large amounts of time and money to recruit, and then drop all of that priority once the employee has been hired. It's reasonable to do so given employees are sticky.

In the short term, it's simpler to treat employees as disposable, since labour is plentiful and there are many more applicants than there are job positions. Think of how investment banking or similar industries churn through batches of analysts every year. You won't see the effect of this immediately, since the basic maintenance work is going to get done just by throwing enough bodies and time at it.

In the long term, the amount of wasted and duplicative training adds up. Something that could have taken an experienced junior a day to do because they've done it before and know who to work with takes a new hire a week to do, at a lower quality too. Since most companies won't hold anyone accountable for this wastage, it'll keep happening over many years.

This problem gets even worse at the senior level. Compare a senior executive at Amazon, [who could have more than two decades of tenure](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/whos-in-charge-at-amazon-moves-on-secretive-s-team-signal-tech-giants-priorities/ "amzn"), against an executive at an investment bank, who would likely have that spread across different banks, if at all. Who will have more context on the issues the company faces, what has been tried before, and what's a waste of time?

One other point of frustration is the **amount of autonomy** that is given to employees. Micromanagement works for tasks that are less complex. For example, if you're manufacturing identical widgets, the process should be the same every time, and this should be managed closely. 

Most of the projects that we work on are not widget manufacturing though. With complex problems, there's no specific solution that will exactly solve the problem. Instead, there's a wide range of possible options to try. By being too obsessed with getting things done their way, managers waste everyone's time.

In the short term, micromanagement delivers results, since your boss can dictate exactly what and how they want something done. In the long term, employees don't learn and get bored of the job, leading to retention issues. Micromanagement is usually the sign of an inexperienced manager who can only see the consequences of the next week's project but not the next year's outcomes.

I'm still wondering what people can do when they find themselves stuck in companies that are bad at the above. My first thought is that they should leave the company and find something better. Another thought is to work on a personal project on the side, to get the autonomy and training that the company will not give. 

What if you're stuck in the role though? Better communication, [like we discussed last week](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/nonviolent-communication "nvc"), can help in managing upwards. Blocking out time on your calendar, particularly in our currently remote situation, to do self-directed learning also seems like an option. Finding a core group of colleagues that are interested in improving and helping each other out might also be feasible.

That said, it feels like the better option for employees is to go find another option. When incentives aren't aligned in a company, it's hard to fix, and I wouldn't be hoping for things to change any time soon.
