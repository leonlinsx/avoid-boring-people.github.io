## Main

When I was in the army, we had a saying: "The Army can't *make* you do anything, but it sure can make you regret not doing so." And it was true; they got two years of obedience out of me during my conscription. Decision making is simple when the alternatives are confinement or jail.

And while I still felt it was a meaningful experience, you can imagine why so many others in my place might have strong feelings against the army. So much so that there's constant pressure in the country to reduce the duration of the stint, the intensity of the exercises, or the selection of the enlistees. A favourite national pastime is to complain about times in the army, right behind complaining about people complaining. 

For an activity that's meant to be a nation-building exercise, it causes more negative emotion against the country than most other life events. We did what we were told, but we didn't do it for the right reasons. And that made all the difference in the short term vs long term.

I don't want to make the army the subject of discussion today - it's a special, closed environment and the people are crazy. Instead, let's look at businesses, which are... special, closed environments with crazy people. Hmm.

Most of us work in some larger company, report to some boss, and are accountable for some goal.
