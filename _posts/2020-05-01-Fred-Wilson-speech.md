**Main**

Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures is one of the more famous VCs based in NYC, due in large part to his popular blog [AVC](https://avc.com/ "AVC"). He recently did an ["Ask Me Anything" style virtual event](https://askmeanythinglivefredwilson.splashthat.com/? "Link") \[1\] at Betaworks; notes below \[2\]:

1. What have you see in how things have reacted to Covid?
  - Covid has definitely been bad, it's a terrible situation
  - Despite broader difficulties though, there are still some areas that are doing better
  - e.g. online education is doing better
  - TOEFL had english language proficiency testing product locked up, now since you can't do that in person, duolingo test being delivered online has gotten more companies and unis to accept them
  - **Markets that were locked before are now unlocked**

**Footnotes**

1. Ask Me Anythings, or AMAs for short, were born from [a Reddit forum](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/ama-how-a-weird-internet-thing-became-a-mainstream-delight/282860/ "AMA") where famous people would answer crowdsourced questions e.g. Obama would get questions in real time from the forum and answer them.
2. Paraphrased for clarity at times
