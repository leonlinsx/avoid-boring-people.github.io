**Main**

Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures is one of the more famous VCs based in NYC, due in large part to his popular blog [AVC](https://avc.com/ "AVC"). He recently did an ["Ask Me Anything" style virtual event](https://askmeanythinglivefredwilson.splashthat.com/? "Link") \[1\] at Betaworks; notes below \[2\]:

**Covid reaactions**

1. What have you see in how markets have reacted to Covid?
  - Covid has definitely been bad, it's a terrible situation
  - Despite broader difficulties though, there are still some areas that are doing better
  - e.g. online education is doing better
  - TOEFL historically had english language proficiency testing product locked up \[3\]. Duolingo had hard time getting universities or companies to accept them since they were online only
  - Since you can't do those tests in person now, Duolingo has had easier time in approaching companies about online products
  - **Markets that were locked before are now unlocked**
  
2. What has worked well and what has not for Etsy in this environment?
  - **Etsy has a decentralised and distributed supply chain**
  - e.g. there were only hundreds of sellers making masks mths ago. Etsy saw more ppl coming on the platform buying masks, and those sellers started selling out. Etsy went out to other sellers on platform to ask them to make masks, put out patterns on how to do so, and over the course of a short period of time got up to tens of thousands of sellers making masks
  - What's great about that is that one single seller might sell out but tens of thousands won't
  - This has allowed Etsy to become a scaled provider of fabric masks
  
LL - Note that Fred is [the Chairman of the Board at Etsy](https://investors.etsy.com/governance/board-of-directors/default.aspx "Etsy"). I agree that having a decentralised supply chain helps in this situation, though I'd push back that the product being sold matters as well. Can't do the above for toilet paper for example.

3. How has Covid changed how USV is investing?
  - USV invests in things that use software to deliver services to customers
  - e.g financial, healthcare, education services, or crypto
  - our thesis isn't going to change much, but we are asking one big question: **which behaviours have we adopted now that we'll quickly get rid of, and which behaviours will we not get rid of?** Whether that's in work, in shopping, in eating etc
  
LL - I feel this is the major question most investors are wondering. I have some preliminary thoughts here and will probably write about them in the future. Initial thought is anything social related will revert to pre Covid.
  
4. What's different in this upheavel vs prior ones?
  - Would look at industries being most disrupted to see e.g. in 2009 crypto came out of the finance crisis
  - There'll be ideas born out of the disruption e.g. telehealth, online learning where there's a real need for those kinds of things given the situation we're in. 
  - More broadly people are saying that "it's great I can just text a doctor and get what i need, I don't need to go to hospital,"
  - I think those behaviour changes are going to be permanent, and we'll not do them the old fashioned way after this

**Raising capital in this environment**

1. What advice would you give to founders trying to raise capital now?
  - I'd look at where you are and what kinds of investors you want
  - Also would look at how badly you need to raise. Do you need capital to get through the next 90 days or would you like to raise now but have enough money till end of year and can even wait for three mths
  - It's not an ideal time, we're all distracted
  
1. How would you use this time to network and keep yourself on radar to better position yourself?
  - Fundraising is always an exercise of trying to find the investor, whether that's an angel, seed investor etc \[4\] who wants to invest in the kind of business you're building
  - It's always critical to try to figure out who those people are
  - Even if you put off raising moeny till june, you can use this period now to find out who are those investors who will invest at your stage and have interest in the problems you're solving
  - If you already have investors, they can help you do that
  - **Now is the time to be doing legwork** if you need to ask other enterpreneurs, investors etc to figure out who you should be targeting
  
LL - If you're running a company, you'll likely benefit from always being in marketing mode. You want investors to know your story before you ask them for capital, regardless of the stage you're in. Even Amazon does investor relations outreach. Unless you think you're better than Amazon, you should be doing so too.

1. Ask Me Anythings, or AMAs for short, were born from [a Reddit forum](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/ama-how-a-weird-internet-thing-became-a-mainstream-delight/282860/ "AMA") where famous people would answer crowdsourced questions e.g. Obama would get questions in real time from the forum and answer them.

4. There are [different stages of venture capital,](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/startup-funding-stages/ "VC") depending on how young and small the company is
