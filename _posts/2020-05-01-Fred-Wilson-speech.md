**Takeaway**

Fred Wilson thinks the big question you should be asking now is what behaviours are going to stick and which are not

**Main**

Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures is one of the more famous VCs based in NYC, due in part to his popular blog [AVC](https://avc.com/ "AVC"). He recently did an ["Ask Me Anything" style virtual event](https://askmeanythinglivefredwilson.splashthat.com/? "Link") \[1\] at [Betaworks](https://betaworks.com/ "Beta"). Notes below \[2\], and Iâ€™ve bucketed them into five categories:

1. General covid reactions
2. Market specific discussions
3. Thoughts on founders raising capital now
4. Thoughts on being a VC now
5. Other

**General Covid reactions**

1. What have you see in how markets have reacted to Covid?
  - Covid has definitely been bad, it's a terrible situation
  - Despite broader difficulties though, there are still some areas that are doing better
  - e.g. online education is doing better
  - TOEFL historically had english language proficiency testing product locked up \[3\]. Duolingo had hard time getting universities or companies to accept them since they were online only
  - Since you can't do those tests in person now, Duolingo has had easier time in approaching companies about online products
  - **Markets that were locked before are now unlocked**
  
2. What has worked well and what has not for Etsy in this environment?
  - **Etsy has a decentralised and distributed supply chain**
  - e.g. there were only hundreds of sellers making masks mths ago. Etsy saw more ppl coming on the platform buying masks, and those sellers started selling out. Etsy went out to other sellers on platform to ask them to make masks, put out patterns on how to do so, and over the course of a short period of time got up to tens of thousands of sellers making masks
  - What's great about that is that one single seller might sell out but tens of thousands won't
  - This has allowed Etsy to become a scaled provider of fabric masks
  
LL - Note that Fred is [the Chairman of the Board at Etsy](https://investors.etsy.com/governance/board-of-directors/default.aspx "Etsy"). I agree that having a decentralised supply chain helps in this situation, though I'd push back that the product being sold matters as well. Can't do the above for toilet paper for example, or even most groceries at scale.

3. How has Covid changed how USV is investing?
  - USV invests in things that use software to deliver services to customers
  - e.g financial, healthcare, education services, or crypto
  - our thesis isn't going to change much, but we are asking one big question: **which behaviours have we adopted now that we'll quickly get rid of, and which behaviours will we not get rid of?** Whether that's in work, in shopping, in eating etc
  
LL - I feel this is the major question most investors are wondering. I have some preliminary thoughts here and will probably write about them in the future. Initial thought is anything social related will revert to pre Covid.
  
4. What's different in this upheaval vs prior ones?
  - Would look at industries being most disrupted to see e.g. in 2009 crypto came out of the finance crisis
  - There'll be ideas born out of the disruption e.g. telehealth, online learning where there's a real need for those kinds of things given the situation we're in. 
  - More broadly people are saying that "it's great I can just text a doctor and get what i need, I don't need to go to hospital,"
  - I think those kinds of behaviour changes are going to be permanent, and we'll not do them the old fashioned way after this
  
5. Do you expect higher % of startups to fold in next few mths, and what advice do you have for them?
  - I think failure rates are absolutely going to go up 
  - Government has done a lot to try keep people on payroll, and that's going to give companies a shot at surviving
  - There already are companies that have had to lighten up on headcount
  - Moves that government has made will have meaningful impact **if business sector can come back by a june timeframe.** That is when many businesses will have to take another look at cost structures
  
LL - most people seem to have written off Q2 for 2020

**Market specific discussion**

6. What are your thoughts on crypto?
  - Whole bunch of things in crypto industry has not solved
  - e.g. crypto still can't deliver a consumer experience as good as the ones that big banks can deliver today. Until we do, crypto will stay in the niche sector it's in today
  - the whole sector is still scary and not for faint of heart, being difficult for non tech-savvy people to get into
  
LL - Things such as Libra, [which I've written about before,](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/would-you-buy-the-libra-neopet-kin "Libra") aren't helping   
  
7. What's your thesis around healthcare?
  - We do not invest in the more scientific part of healthcare such as new therapeutics
  - We invest in entrepreneurs trying to reinvent how healthcare is delivered, and usually they're using software to do that.
  - This will lower cost, increase access, increase uptake 
  - We were already seeing that to be true pre covid, and now there's a huge boost for people to get access they need more quickly and more inexpensively   
  
8. Is there going to be increased pressure on universities that don't invest in education tech?
  - Yes. Places that were historically not really excited about the idea of teaching or learning online, and now all of a certain that's all they're doing, they have no other choice
  
LL - Historically healthcare and education are two sectors in the US that have been resistant to change in large part to regulation. With those regulatory barriers temporarily removed due to Covid, perhaps they're not going to come back. 

**Founders raising capital in this environment**

9. What advice would you give to founders trying to raise capital now?
  - I'd look at where you are and what kinds of investors you want
  - Also would look at how badly you need to raise. Do you need capital to get through the next 90 days, or would you like to raise now but have enough money till end of year and can even wait for three mths
  - It's not an ideal time, we're all distracted
  
10. How would you use this time to network and keep yourself on radar to better position yourself?
  - Fundraising is always an exercise of trying to find the investor, whether that's an angel, seed investor etc \[4\] who wants to invest in the kind of business you're building
  - It's always critical to try to figure out who those people are
  - Even if you put off raising money till june, you can use this period now to find out who are those investors who will invest at your stage and have interest in the problems you're solving
  - If you already have investors, they can help you do that
  - **Now is the time to be doing legwork** if you need to ask other entrepreneurs, investors etc to figure out who you should be targeting
  
LL - If you're running a company, you'll likely benefit from always being in marketing mode. You want investors to know your story before you ask them for capital, regardless of the stage you're in. Even Amazon does investor relations outreach. Unless you think you're better than Amazon, you should be doing so too.

11. Are VCs open for business?
  - Leaving aside the angel side of venture \[5\], VCs raise money every 2-3 yrs and are obligated to put money to work. As a VC you can't just sit on money
  - The VC market is open for business, though I think everyone's distracted
  - A lot of current portfolio companies will need inside rounds of financing
  - That will ease up in time though
  
LL - I've heard anecdotally that where some VCs used to spend a third of their time on existing portfolio companies, now they're spending half of their time. Naturally that means they can meet fewer new companies in the remainder of their time.

**Being a VC in this environment**

12. What advice do you have for new managers trying to raise a VC fund?
  - It's a very difficult time now
  - Until recently there were stories of people raising a new fund in 3-6 mths
  - Contrast that to my experience in the early days. We didn't have our first close until 2004, after starting in 2003. And it took almost 2 years till 2005 to finish \[6\]
  - If you can take that amount of time out of career than you can think about it, but if not don't expect to close your fundraising in 3-6 mths anymore
  
13. How do you think the VC industry will be changed by this?
  - We're still figuring out how to make investments without meeting people in person
  - Hard to get used to
  - Now leaning more on getting references on people being able to reference ppl
  - Spending more time with the founders on video calls than we would have in person
  
LL - There are people that will say they've been raising without meeting in person for years, though that's the minority. I think this will help, but we'll largely revert to in person meetings. Virtual meetings will have to significantly increase in fidelity and how lifelike they are before we're more comfortable.
  
14. What tools are you using to get more confident when doing diligence on a person?
  - It's been a little lazy of us to think we have a good nose, making investments by sitting in a room and getting good vibes to justify backing a person
  - But that's what the industry has relied on since 80s
  - What I've encouraged people to do is to do more reference checking via linkedin or back channel references
  - I think this is going to be good for the industry. It's going to make it more possible for people who haven't been able to access VC market to do so. Will allow us to back people in more analytical ways rather than social ways
  
LL - I'm less optimistic, still feel that networks are going to remain highly important. On the margin it'll help some marginalised founders, but due to pattern recognition many will still get ignored.

**Other**

15. What books have been most influential for shaping your thinking?
  - [Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital](https://www.amazon.com/Technological-Revolutions-Financial-Capital-Dynamics/dp/1843763311 "Carlota") by Carolota Perez
  - Can be dry at times but important to know
  
LL - I have heard this book mentioned multiple times now, guess I need to read it
  
16. Do you have examples of successful companies that have done remote offices from the start, without having a central office?
  - Indeed.com had two founders and they were not in the same city
  - I don't think it's so much a question of can you do it, but it's a question of can you create an organisation and culture that will be good to be in, one that is where work happens
   - duckduckgo, wordpress are other examples
   
17. Once you open up, will proximity of your office be less important?
  - Yes. If everything we've talked about is right, being less location sensitive in our investing is something we should embrace
  - This crisis will make it easier to do that
  - I still think language and cultural differences are something we can't overcome easily. e.g. hearing a pitch by someone less proficient in english is still more difficult for me  

**Footnotes**

1. Ask Me Anythings, or AMAs for short, were born from [a Reddit forum](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/ama-how-a-weird-internet-thing-became-a-mainstream-delight/282860/ "AMA") where famous people would answer crowdsourced questions e.g. Obama would get questions in real time from the forum and answer them.
2. Paraphrased for clarity at times
3. This is a test that many international students have to take to prove they have proficiency in english before coming to the States to study. 
4. There are [different stages of venture capital,](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/startup-funding-stages/ "VC") depending on how young and small the company is
5. Angels are usually individual investors, so they're investing their own money rather than a company's capital
6. When you're a professional investor, you don't invest just your own money. You go around raising money from other people and institutions, and use that total amount of capital. When you're done getting all that money from others you've "closed" the fundraising process
