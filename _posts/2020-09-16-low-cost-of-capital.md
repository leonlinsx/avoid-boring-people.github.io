### Main

I want to take a look at **cost of capital** today. I've been wondering what the implications are of our current low cost environment, plus [Michael Pettis](https://carnegieendowment.org/chinafinancialmarkets/82610 "Pettis") recently wrote a good article on interest rates vs growth, so let's look closer at this topic. I won't have all the answers either, so comments are definitely welcome, either reply directly or on the post's comment box.

For those who don't know what cost of capital is, not to worry. I'll provide a brief explanation of the concept, before making the following points:

- Cost of capital is lower now than historically
- As a result, there is a wealth transfer from savers to borrowers
- This also implies that more risk taking should occur

#### Cost of capital is the blended cost of financing your idea
