### Main

I want to take a look at **cost of capital** today. I've been wondering what the implications are of our current low cost environment, plus [Michael Pettis](https://carnegieendowment.org/chinafinancialmarkets/82610 "Pettis") recently wrote a good article on interest rates vs growth, so let's look closer at this topic. I won't have all the answers either, so comments are definitely welcome, either reply directly or on the post's comment box.

For those who don't know what cost of capital is, not to worry. I'll provide a brief explanation of the concept, before making the following points:

- Cost of capital is lower now than historically
- As a result, there is a wealth transfer from savers to borrowers
- This also implies that more risk taking should occur

#### Cost of capital is the blended cost of financing your idea

Imagine you had an idea. It could be a new business idea, an expansion plan, or even some investment you were thinking of. All that matters is it requires money (capital), and hopefully returns you more money than you put in.

How do you get this money? There are two main sources of capital: debt and equity \[1\].

When you get cash in exchange for debt, you agree to pay back some amounts of the debt over time. We can calculate a cost of that, based on whatever the final percentage rate of return is. For example, if you paid $10 on $100, that's a 10% cost \[2\].

When you get cash in exchange for equity, you don't have to pay cash back, but you give up ownership. The amount that you give up depends on the expected return that investors have. We can calculate an implied cost of that. For example, if an investor put in money expecting a 20% return, that's a 20% cost \[3\].

The blended costs of both of these main sources of capital combine to give you your cost of capital. This is the average cost that you will incur by trying the idea. For example, if your cost of capital is 5%, you're "losing" 5% every year. 

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cost capital/cost capital 3.png)

It also follows that you want to make more than your cost of capital. If you're losing 5% a year, you need to make more than 5% in order to get a positive return. If your business returns 1% a year while costing 5%, you lose money over time.

That was a simplified explanation, but it should give enough intuition for the rest of the article. If you're interested in reading more, the king of valuation, NYU Prof Damodaran, [has a paper explaining this in detail](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/papers/costofcapital.pdf "Cost"), which includes graphics like the below that rigourously extend the framework we discussed above. 

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cost capital/cost capital 1.png)

Put another way: We want to make money. We need money. That money comes at a cost, which is the cost of capital.

#### Cost of capital is lower now

First, let's establish the case that it's less costly to get money now than before. To do so, we'll look at a few graphs over time of rates.

This is the past 10 years of the 10 year TIPS yield, [pulled from the Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII10 "Fed") \[4\]. For those unfamiliar with TIPS, they're an [inflation linked, "safe" type of debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tips.asp "tips"). As we can see, yields are currently negative, having trended down over time.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cost capital/cost capital 4.png)

This is the past 10 years of the 30 year fixed rate mortgage cost, [also pulled from the Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=NUh "Fed") \[5\]. We can see the cost of borrowing for a house has fallen as well.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cost capital/cost capital 5.png)

And if you think I'm cherry picking by only looking at 10 years, let's zoom out to the past 54 years, and look at the 10 year treasury rate. You can see the spike in rates before [Volcker killed inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Volcker "Volcker"), and the continued downtrend since. 

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cost capital/cost capital 6.png)

At this point I think we've shown the cost of **debt** has declined. What about the cost of equity? 

I had more trouble finding average cost of equity, but we know that the cost of equity is related to the cost of debt, plus some additional return for the risk associated with equity \[6\]. We've shown the cost of debt has declined, so if we can find the trend in the additional return (the equity risk premium), we'll understand the trend better.

[Damodaran has a table in pg 142 of this report](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=425124115112025116020118020011112064052051040011030092064114074119081098025103109118097012061055040113125093125106096026106103051022049037045010068078022028103006044010102031118000094024104112069074071073106074113116005029084117013074087122064008&EXT=pdf "Damodaran") showing a slight increase in risk premium over time. For a more visual version, [KPMG has the numbers below.](https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/nl/pdf/2020/services/equitiy-market-risk-premium-research-summary-march-2020.pdf "KPMG") They don't tie out exactly, but are relatively consistent. 

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cost capital/cost capital 7.png)

There's a slight increase in recent months, but overall equity risk premiums haven't risen as much as the cost of debt has declined. That implies that on net, the cost of **equity** has either been flat, or declined. 

From the above, we've shown that the cost of capital has declined. This implies that raising money now, either via debt or equity, is cheaper than before.

#### Lowered cost of capital implies wealth transfers from savers to borrowers

Let's introduce a complication. Above we said that a business should aim to grow more than their costs. People have extended this concept to countries, claiming that debt is sustainable when the growth rate of GDP (return) is more than the interest rate (cost of capital). To do so, they often cite famous economist Thomas Piketty's work, [Capital in the Twenty-First Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century "Capital").

[Michael Pettis argues here](https://carnegieendowment.org/chinafinancialmarkets/82610 "int") that extending the framework to countries doesn't make sense. Instead:

> At the macroeconomic level, the relationship between interest rates and GDP reveals much more about income transfers and the distribution of income within an economy than it does about the overall sustainability of that economyâ€™s debt. In this respect, conditions operate quite differently for countries than for individuals or businesses

Let's break down what he means, since this isn't immediately obvious. Pettis is saying that an implication of costs being lower than growth is that **the economy moves money away from people who are providing capital, towards those that are borrowing it.**

If you had money and were lending it out, you're lending it out at the market cost. If you invested it in the broad economy, you're getting market growth. If that cost is lower than the average growth (rate of return), you've gotten a lower yielding asset compared to the higher yielding one before. Vice versa if the cost is higher than the growth rate.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cost capital/cost capital 8.png)

This has differing implications on future growth as well as wealth inequality. The wealthy save more, so lowered costs result in a wealth transfer from the rich to the poor. This is offset by increased speculation on assets, which shifts wealth the other way. The net effect of this depends on relative size of each. Pettis doesn't make this point, but **I believe that the speculation piece has more than offset the former effect, and that's a cause of rising wealth inequality.**

#### Lowered cost of capital implies more risk taking should occur



### Footnotes

1. There are many variations of debt, equity, and hybrid securities like convertibles (part debt, part equity). For ease of discussion let's stick to just the two
2. I'm not going into yields vs interest rates to keep things simple, read [here](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/fixed-income-bonds/bond-prices-rates-yields "fidelity") for a start to learn more.
3. Whether they get that return is a different matter. Remember we're just dealing with expectations here, not actual returns. To make the example more concrete, imagine if the investor had a higher cost of equity return hurdle, say 100%. If they still wanted to invest in you, they would either have to demand a lower valuation, so that they can get a higher exit vs entry multiple. Or they demand more ownership for the same amount of cash.
