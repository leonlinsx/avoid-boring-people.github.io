### Takeaway

You need mindful, deliberate practice in order to improve. Practicing while zoned out can take a lot of effort but yield no improvement.

### The learning stops when the automation starts

Today I want to talk about practice. Some of the below might seem obvious, but I find myself forgetting all the time or getting lazy, so I wanted to cover the topic briefly in a post.

We generally want to improve at the regular activities that we do, whether that's work or a personal hobby. If someone told us that we'd not improve at what we did, most of us would feel a sense of de-motivation to continue doing the activity.

That's ok for some tasks, where the frequency is low or the skill ceiling of the task is low i.e. a high skilled person is about as effective as a low skilled person.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Deliberate practice 1.png)

However, for many other tasks, we do actually want to improve, since we know that we become more effective. For example, being better at excel or lifting more weight.

We also know that practice is necessary in order to improve. We don't get better just by hoping we wake up somehow magically different. 

That is the first part where most people fail, since most of us get too caught up in doing the thing, that we don't bother specifically practicing for the thing. If we can just get by in the office working on what we're asked to do, or have an enjoyable game of sport, that's enough to just stop there. 

Even if we do have the discipline and motivation to practice though, many of us practice wrongly.

The second part where most people fail, is in how they structure the practice. **Putting in the hours is important, and it's not sufficient.** You can put in a lot of effort, but not be rewarded with improvement. Instead, you need to be doing [deliberate practice](https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice(PsychologicalReview).pdf "practice"). Rather than focus on skills you can do, you should be doing exercises that are at the edge of your ability.

This is difficult, and doesn't come naturally. For many people:

- It's hard to view yourself objectively in the first place to find out what you need to work on
- Since your weaknesses are what you're most uncomfortable or unfamiliar with, it's easy to get de-motivated when practising this way. You probably get worse before getting better
- Deliberate drills usually seem boring, but you need to remain mentally engaged while doing them. If you zone out because they're boring, it defeats the purpose of the drill

In other words, improvement requires:

1. Getting feedback on what you're doing
2. Figuring out what will actually help your weaknesses
3. Mindfully practicing specific exercises to fix your weaknesses

For the first part, the ideal option would be an expert coach. That's out of reach for many (including me, unless anyone's offering), so you'll have to find an alternative. People usually end up getting feedback through work, friends, or random internet strangers. Particularly for work, remember that performance conversations are partially an evaluation, but also an expressed wish by your boss on possible improvements. 

Getting feedback can be a tough conversation, but it's necessary as we've seen. I've found [Thanks for the Feedback](https://www.npr.org/books/titles/441536239/thanks-for-the-feedback-the-science-and-art-of-receiving-feedback-well-even-when "thanks") to be helpful for navigating such chats, and have previously done a summary [here](https://www.leonlinsx.com/thanks-for-the-feedback/ "feedback"). Some of the main points include knowing what type of feedback conversation it is, knowing what you're triggered by in conversations, and clarifying the issues.

And if you absolutely can't find anyone, even after posting on sketchy internet message boards, then you could always do a self reflection as a weaker substitute. We're not that good at understanding ourselves usually, but it's better than stagnating due to inactivity.

After knowing what your issues are, you now need to figure out solutions. Sometimes, the provider of your feedback is able to give you tips for this. However, sometimes the provider might not know either, or might think they know what you should do, but actually don't (Unfortunately, if it's the latter case, you'll probably only find out way too late)

If you're not given exercises to do, then you need to come up with your own. This is where a solid understanding of theory comes in. Many people end up dismissing the importance of theory, with the mindset that "real world experience" is all that matters. The downside to that mindset is that once you have issues, it'll be hard to diagnose what the cause is, and how you should go about fixing it. 

For example, if you're trying to [improve your posture,](https://www.painscience.com/tutorials/trigger-points.php "trigger") and do the first couple of exercises on google, you might get some improvement, but probably miss fixing the root cause. However, if you start getting a better understanding of your anatomy, what muscles are tight and what muscles are weak, you'll be able to specifically fix your muscle imbalances in a more effective way. 

After figuring out the theory, you need to regularly work on drills. You don't have to do them every day, but more than once a week would be ideal. It's also really easy to cheat on drills, so make sure you understand why you're working that drill every time before you start.

To give a few examples:
- If you're learning math, you can't practice the same "type" of problem over and over. Textbooks are filled with alternative types of problems, even though the concepts tested are the same. The reason for that is to make you understand the theory under multiple contexts, making you more versatile and cementing the theory.
- If you're practicing gymnastics, you need to have muscle awareness and consciously engage the muscles you're trying to work on while doing drills. If you zone out, you'll let your body default to whatever's comfortable, hence not fixing the problem.
- If you're trying to get better at communications for work, you need to stop yourself and think of your message before you start sending it. You can also experiment with a few alternatives, in order to figure out what works best
- [Nat Eliason has a longer list here for other activities](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/deliberate-practice-examples "examples")

The reason this popped up in my mind was due to a mistake I made with the above that I only just recently discovered. I'd been mindlessly doing an exercise drill for years thinking it was helping a shoulder problem. However, after I learnt more about shoulder anatomy, I realised I was doing the drill incorrectly, engaging the wrong muscle groups. That and some other fixes have gone a long way towards improving my shoulder mobility in a matter of days. All because for years I hadn't really understood why I was doing what I was doing.

In summary, there's many activities in life we want to get better at. The first step is to get the discipline and motivation to practice, which is good. That's not enough though, and you need to also get feedback on what's wrong, knowledge of theory to understand why that's happening, and then practice consciously to fix those mistakes. When you start feeling like you're in cruising mode, you've stopped improving.
