      .iframe-container iframe { 
         border: 0;

### The learning stops when the automation starts

Today I want to talk about practice. Some of the below might seem obvious, but I find myself forgetting all the time or getting lazy, so I wanted to cover the topic briefly in a post.

We generally want to improve at the regular activities that we do, whether that's work or a personal hobby. If someone told us that we'd not improve at what we did, most of us would feel a sense of de-motivation to continue doing the activity. 

We also know that practice is necessary in order to improve. We don't get better just by hoping we wake up somehow magically different. 

That is the first part where most people fail, since most of us get too caught up in doing the thing, that we don't bother specifically practicing for the thing. If we can just get by in the office working on what we're asked to do, or have an enjoyable game of sport, that's enough to just stop there. 

The second part where most people fail, is in how they structure the practice. Putting in the hours is important, and it's not sufficient. You can put in a lot of effort, but not be rewarded with improvement. Instead, you need to be doing [deliberate practice](https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice(PsychologicalReview).pdf "practice"). Rather than focus on skills you can do, you should be doing exercises that are at the edge of your ability.
