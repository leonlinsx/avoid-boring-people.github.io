### Takeaway

<style>
      .iframe-container {
        overflow: hidden;        
        padding-top: 50%; <!-- Calculated from the aspect ration of the content (in case of 16:9 it is 9/16= 0.5625) -->
        position: relative;
      }
      .iframe-container iframe { 
         border: 0;
         height: 100%; <!-- Finally, width and height are set to 100% so the iframe takes up 100% of the containers space. -->
         left: 0;
         position: absolute;
         top: 0;
         width: 100%;
         display: block;
         margin: 0 auto; <!-- center image -->
      }
      <!-- 4x3 Aspect Ratio -->

### Detection

Zipf

Analytics Vidhya did a post a while back on [how to detect computer generated articles.](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/12/detect-fight-neural-fake-news-nlp/ "Vidhya") They provide a few tools and links, such as [Grover,](https://grover.allenai.org/detect "Grover") that can take the text and tell you if they believe it was machine generated.

Here's a demo. I went to the first sample in the appendix of the [GPT 3 paper (page 49)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf "GPT"), and copied the machine generated poem there. Plugging that in to Grover's site, shows me that Grover thinks it was machine generated.
