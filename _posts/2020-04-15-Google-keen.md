**Main**

I was invited to try a beta of [Keen](https://staykeen.com/ "Keen"), a new product from [Area 120, Google's workshop for experimental products](https://area120.google.com/ "120") \[1\]. Keen is meant to "help you expand your interests", by "staying keen on your interests, getting recommendations, and curating good ideas". Like my prior posts on [Hoppin](https://www.leonlinsx.com/hoppin/ "Hoppin") or [Cosign](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/would-you-cosign-your-ai-chess-partner "Cosign"), let's take a closer look at the product.

**Signup and user flow**

The signup process is straightforward if you have a Google account and are already logged in on your browser. I didn't see an option for people without Google accounts, and assume that'll change once they're out of Beta.

After you're signed up, the first view is that of a tiled screen, with a large plus sign to the left. The other tiles seem to be of various topics that I might be interested in checking out. If there was ever an argument that Google isn't spying on you and your data, this could be it, since none of the initial suggestions were close to my interests. Perhaps they pre-populate it based on what the average American might be interested in?

It was unclear what I was supposed to be doing first between the plus sign and the other cards, so I clicked on the plus sign.

This brought me to a "create" option, where I could type in what I was keen to do. Hence the name, I'd imagine. Being always on the lookout for more opportunities to shill my newsletter \[2\], I put in "Writing". 

There was also an option at the bottom to "email me about new finds". I'd normally not want more emails, even for a new service, but I left the box checked since I wanted to see what the email suggestions would be like. As of writing this I haven't received an email yet; I'll update the post if there's anything significant to highlight.

The next step gave a text box to "list searches or questions you want results for." I was unsure whether putting as many searches as possible was better than just having one phrase, so I only put in one search query. I assumed that this would give me more targeted results compared to putting a long list of phrases, but can't confirm it

I could also add members to this list (a Keen?). Since I have no friends I left that untouched, just like most of us in quarantine.

That was the last step in creating this tile/card/keen \[3\]. I ended up on a screen that reminded me a bit of Pinterest. There were 3 items on the navigation menu, "feed," "gems," and "following". Below that was the page and items for whatever I'd chosen on the menu. In the screenshot below you can see I'm still on "feed."

The site now prompted me to add a gem to my collection, and to also gem what I loved.

- Can't seem to toggle a collection public after initially setting it private
- Other collections seem to be auto-created and added to my feed, even though they're private
- Can't seem to add tags when making a gem
- Can't seem to customise how the gem looks
- Asking a question flow leads nowhere
- Opening a card leads to a 2 line preview of the article, not the article itself. 
- Why is there no home feed of all the gems I want?
- Can't add a gem without a keen?

**Footnotes**
1. Not as exclusive as it sounds, I was just in a slack group with a person who was handing them out
2. Did you know I write things like this regularly at [Avoid Boring People?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/ "ABP")
3. I could be mistaken, but think that the phrase "keen" hadn't been surfaced in the product at this point yet
