**Main**

- Can't seem to toggle a collection public after initially setting it private
- Other collections seem to be auto-created and added to my feed, even though they're private
- Can't seem to add tags when making a gem
- Can't seem to customise how the gem looks
- Asking a question flow leads nowhere
- Opening a card leads to a 2 line preview of the article, not the article itself. 
- Why is there no home feed of all the gems I want?
- Can't add a gem without a keen?
