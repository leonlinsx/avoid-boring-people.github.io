## Main

One good thing about getting older is you get to know yourself better. Your likes, your dislikes, and 

I've been frustrated at people without understanding why, not even knowing what I'd want them to do differently. 

Nonviolent communication (NVC)

NVC process:

1. Actions we **observe** that are affecting our well-being
2. How we **feel** in relation to that observation
3. The **needs** that are creating those feelings
4. The actions we **request** to improve our lives

[Thanks for the feedback](https://www.leonlinsx.com/thanks-for-the-feedback/ "feedback"), how to get better at taking feedback

I often treat other people's feedback as an evaluation of my ability, resulting in self-doubt about my ability

Separate observation from evaluation

Understand our feelings

Understand our needs

Growing from emotional slavery to emotional liberation

Clearly communicate what we want others to do for us

Requests vs Demands

People need to be understood, empathy

Limitations on punishment
