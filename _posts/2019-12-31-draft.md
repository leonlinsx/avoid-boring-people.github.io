**Takeaways**

1. What is the optimal seed stage investing strategy?
2.
3. What do Michael Phelps and JK Rowling have in common?

**Index all the (seed stage) things**

AngelList released research claiming that "seed stage investors would increase their expected return by broadly indexing into every credible deal, a finding that does not hold at later stages." If true, this could imply VCs don't have much value add at early stage rounds, contrary to popular belief.

AngelList is naturally biased since they have [their own venture investing index product](https://angel.co/v/venture/invest "AngelList"), but let's take a look at their methodology and findings \[1\]:

> we rely on two concepts. The first is that startups tend to grow faster in their earliest years \[...\] The second is that early-stage investments have longer durations than later-stage investments in those same companies, which is tautological. Taken together, the two concepts imply that winning early-stage investments have more years to compound at higher rates of growth.

Growth rates tend to slow once you scale, so the first concept makes sense. It's harder to do 10% growth on $1bn vs $1000, as anyone from the Chinese government to Facebook would remind us when issuing financial guidance. 

I was confused by the duration concept at first, thinking AngelList meant that the average time between fundraising rounds increases as you get later stage, which is not an obvious conclusion \[2\]. This wasn't what they meant though, they're simply saying that an early-stage investment is earlier than a later-stage investment in that company. If you invested in the Series A, you've had longer and higher growth rates to compound your money at compared to investing in the Series D.

> after five years a winning seed-stage investment begins to draw its return multiple distribution from an α < 2 (i.e., unbounded mean) power law. This means that the regret an investor could have for missing a winning seed-stage investment is theoretically infinite

Venture returns tend to follow a power law distribution rather than a normal distribution, implying that outlier extreme values are a feature rather than an exception. See [here](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/courses/7000/csci7000-001_2011_L2.pdf "Santa Fe") for more info on power laws.

This applies both for company returns:

![power]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/US venture return distribution.png)

As well as returns of the VC firms:

![power]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/US venture firms return distribution.png)

There are different types of power laws \[3\], and AngelList is claiming that early-stage venture returns follow a particular kind that implies infinite return and variance. Missing out on any single seed investment that goes on to become a unicorn would lead you to have theoretically unlimited loss.

> investors in different rounds of fundraising experience different distributions of expected returns for their winning investments, and that these distributions change so much over a startup’s lifetime that early- and late-stage venture capital should be treated as distinct asset classes

Given how private investors already differentiate themselves based on what stage they invest in, this sounds reasonable. Case in point:

![Seed]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/First Round no B.png)

AngelList filters their dataset based on the following criteria:

> three filters of (1) winning syndicates that (2) have had at least one year to season (or have exited) and (3) for which we know the date of the seed round, leaves us with a database of 684 non-negative investments, constituting 487 initial seed investments and 197 later follow-on investments into those the same companies

Filters 2 and 3 make sense on first glance, since we want to exclude anamolous or incomplete data. We'll come back to filter 1 shortly.

What follows is then a bunch of math that I won't get into during the holidays \[4\], which concludes that 

1) company growth rates fall

![Angel]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/AngelList growth slows.png)

and 2) the most extreme power law distributions apply only to early stage, year one or earlier investments.

![Angel]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/AngelList power law early.png)

In other words, you want to get in as early in companies as possible, and the more you can get in the better. 

"Well, of course if you restrict yourself to just winning investments, you'll get this conclusion". The report responds to this by claiming:

> as long as a constant fraction of investments lose money, money-losing investments will only affect the quantitative, rather than qualitative, properties of the investment class

If you're adding negative 100% returns to a distribution that has infinite mean and variance, it affects your final return but not the shape of the distribution itself. Theoretically you should still get in as many companies as you can.

> However, we do not feel that investing in everything is practical \[...\] Consequently, our results suggest that at the seed stage investors should put money into every investment that clears some minimum threshold

This is the most problematic part of the paper for me \[5\]. We've just concluded that we should invest in as many companies as we can, and now have to subject them to an arbitrary filter. AngelList suggests something like “Is there a version of this company that could raise a Series A from a VC?” which seems to require subjective judgement, leading us back to inferring that VCs do have value add on the investment process after all. If there is some threshold to be met, I'd assume some people are better at defining and analysing that threshold than others, and should be compensated accordingly. 

It's plausible that indexing in seed stage investing is the optimal strategy, just as indexing in public market investing is ideal for the average person. [Jack Bogle was laughed at during the creation of Vanguard](https://pressroom.vanguard.com/news/Press-Release-Vanguard-Announces-Passing-Of-Founder-Jack-Bogle-011619.html "Vanguard"); indexing seed stage investments could follow the same path. Until there is more work done on how to create that threshold though, I have 25% certainty that seed stage index investing affects the returns of established VC firms in the next 3 years.

**Kindness**

Many years ago, a friend invited me to thanksgiving dinner in his dorm. We weren't super close, and I appreciated the invite since I wasn't doing anything then, on account of being a broke international student. We had a fun small group dinner and I got to meet his other friends. It was a good time.

Three weeks later my friend killed himself.

Once in a while I remember this happened. 

I remember how mad I felt.

Then how sad. 

And I remember him.

Every December I write about this to remind myself and others to get some perspective. There are things more important than VC returns and capital allocation. Suicide is still stigmatised; depression downplayed. 

Think only losers get depression? Here are some highly successful individuals:

![pics]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Celebs with depression.png)

Know what else they have in common? [They've all suffered from depression.](https://www.webmd.com/depression/ss/slideshow-depression-celebs "WebMD") Yes, even one of the greatest olympians and best-selling authors were depressed. If you are depressed, know that you are not alone. *It is not your fault*. 

If you are depressed and feeling suicidal, please *reach out for help*. Close friends or family might not realise what you are going through if you don't tell them.

Don't want to talk to your friends? The suicide hotline is 1-800-273-8255 \[30\]

Don't even want to talk on the phone? There's a texting service, text 741 741 \[30\]

For the rest of us lucky enough to go through life without illness, know that some of your friends may be secretly suffering. Look out for them, and be there for them. Depression is a real illness, not just something 'to get over'. People aren't blamed for falling sick; neither should they be blamed for becoming depressed. [This talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_solomon_depression_the_secret_we_share? "TED talk") is helpful for getting some understanding of what depression is like.

As we head out of the holiday season and into the new decade, let's try to be [just a little bit more kind.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOaVJufPqUU&t=0m38s "Kindness") A little bit can go a long way.

2. Carta's separate dataset [here](https://carta.com/blog/getting-funded-how-long-does-it-actually-take/ "Carta") seems to imply the opposite, that median time between funding rounds increases.
