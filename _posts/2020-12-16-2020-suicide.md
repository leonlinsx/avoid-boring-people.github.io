His face is fading.

A friend from gymnastics once invited me to his dorm for Thanksgiving dinner. It was fun but uneventful; the typical thanksgiving turkey and green beans and and above average pie-to-person ratio. I barely remember who was there or what happened. 

He killed himself a few weeks later. That, I do remember.



I may not remember faces.

But I remember him.

> *"The morning after I killed myself, I woke up.*

> *I made myself breakfast in bed. I added salt and pepper to my eggs and used my toast for a cheese and bacon sandwich. I squeezed a grapefruit into a juice glass. I scraped the ashes from the frying pan and rinsed the butter off the counter. I washed the dishes and folded the towels.*

> *The morning after I killed myself, I fell in love. Not with the boy down the street or the middle school principal. Not with the everyday jogger or the grocer who always left the avocados out of the bag. I fell in love with my mother and the way she sat on the floor of my room holding each rock from my collection in her palms until they grew dark with sweat. I fell in love with my father down at the river as he placed my note into a bottle and sent it into the current. With my brother who once believed in unicorns but who now sat in his desk at school trying desperately to believe I still existed.*

> *The morning after I killed myself, I walked the dog. I watched the way her tail twitched when a bird flew by or how her pace quickened at the sight of a cat. I saw the empty space in her eyes when she reached a stick and turned around to greet me so we could play catch but saw nothing but sky in my place. I stood by as strangers stroked her muzzle and she wilted beneath their touch like she did once for mine.*

> *The morning after I killed myself, I went back to the neighbors’ yard where I left my footprints in concrete as a two year old and examined how they were already fading. I picked a few daylilies and pulled a few weeds and watched the elderly woman through her window as she read the paper with the news of my death. I saw her husband spit tobacco into the kitchen sink and bring her her daily medication.*

> *The morning after I killed myself, I watched the sun come up. Each orange tree opened like a hand and the kid down the street pointed out a single red cloud to his mother.*

> *The morning after I killed myself, I went back to that body in the morgue and tried to talk some sense into her. I told her about the avocados and the stepping stones, the river and her parents. I told her about the sunsets and the dog and the beach.*

> *The morning after I killed myself, I tried to unkill myself, but couldn’t finish what I started."  - Meggie Royer*

Many years ago, a friend invited me to thanksgiving dinner in his dorm. We weren't super close, and I appreciated the invite since I wasn't doing anything then, on account of being a broke international student. We had a fun small group dinner and I got to meet his other friends. It was a good time.

**Three weeks later on Dec 17 my friend killed himself.**

Once in a while I remember this happened. 

I remember how mad I felt.

Then how sad. 

And I remember him.

Every December I write about this to remind myself and others to get some perspective. There are things more important than VC returns and capital allocation. Suicide is still stigmatised; depression downplayed. 

Think only losers get depression? Here are some highly successful people:

Know what else they have in common? [They've all suffered from depression.](https://www.webmd.com/depression/ss/slideshow-depression-celebs "WebMD") Yes, even some of the greatest olympians and best-selling authors were depressed. If you are depressed, know that you are not alone. *It is not your fault*. 

If you are depressed and feeling suicidal, *please reach out for help*. Close friends or family might not realise what you are going through if you don't tell them.

Don't want to talk to your friends? The suicide hotline is 1-800-273-8255 \[10\]

Don't even want to talk on the phone? There's a texting service, text 741 741 \[10\]

For the rest of us lucky enough to go through life without illness, know that some of your friends may be secretly suffering. Look out for them, and be there for them. Depression is a real illness, not just something 'to get over'. People aren't blamed for falling sick; neither should they be blamed for becoming depressed. [This talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_solomon_depression_the_secret_we_share? "TED talk") is helpful for getting some understanding of what depression is like.

As we head out of the holiday season and into the new decade, let's try to be [just a little bit more kind.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOaVJufPqUU&t=0m38s "Kindness") A little bit can go a long way.
