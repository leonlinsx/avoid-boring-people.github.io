Many years ago, a friend invited me to thanksgiving dinner in his dorm. We weren't super close, and I appreciated the invite since I wasn't doing anything then, on account of being a broke international student. We had a fun small group dinner and I got to meet his other friends. It was a good time.

**Three weeks later on Dec 17 my friend killed himself.**

Once in a while I remember this happened. 

I remember how mad I felt.

Then how sad. 

And I remember him.

Every December I write about this to remind myself and others to get some perspective. There are things more important than VC returns and capital allocation. Suicide is still stigmatised; depression downplayed. 

Think only losers get depression? Here are some highly successful people:

Know what else they have in common? [They've all suffered from depression.](https://www.webmd.com/depression/ss/slideshow-depression-celebs "WebMD") Yes, even some of the greatest olympians and best-selling authors were depressed. If you are depressed, know that you are not alone. *It is not your fault*. 

If you are depressed and feeling suicidal, *please reach out for help*. Close friends or family might not realise what you are going through if you don't tell them.

Don't want to talk to your friends? The suicide hotline is 1-800-273-8255 \[10\]

Don't even want to talk on the phone? There's a texting service, text 741 741 \[10\]

For the rest of us lucky enough to go through life without illness, know that some of your friends may be secretly suffering. Look out for them, and be there for them. Depression is a real illness, not just something 'to get over'. People aren't blamed for falling sick; neither should they be blamed for becoming depressed. [This talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_solomon_depression_the_secret_we_share? "TED talk") is helpful for getting some understanding of what depression is like.

As we head out of the holiday season and into the new decade, let's try to be [just a little bit more kind.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOaVJufPqUU&t=0m38s "Kindness") A little bit can go a long way.
