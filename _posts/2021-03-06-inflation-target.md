## Main

I don't understand inflation.

I get the concept of prices rising, sure. But for the longest time I haven't understood what *causes* inflation, how to *measure* inflation, and how to *adjust* inflation.

**I also have a feeling nobody really knows either.** 

That's ridiculous, you might say, there's a whole group of people out there [making policy on inflation targets](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/economy_14400.htm "fed") and talking about hedging against inverted yield curves and if google trends is to be believed, some sonic the hedgehog game [(apparently some weird nsfw meme).](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicInflationAdventure "sonic")

Yeah, but that doesn't mean they know the causes for what they're working on. If my work experience has taught me anything, it's that people can do huge amounts of work without understanding what they're doing \[1\]. Nassim Taleb wrote about this before, in a story of a finance trader becoming successful trading green lumber [without understanding what it was.](https://fs.blog/2016/11/green-lumber-fallacy/ "taleb")

A big problem with inflation is firstly deciding what counts towards it. **This is not a trivial task,** and if you think it is, ask yourself these questions:

- What broad categories of "things" do you want to include? Only goods? What about services? 
- Whatever thing you include, how are you going to measure its price? 
- How do you account for outlier data points, such as when toilet paper pricing spikes?
- How often do you take measurements?
- How do I account for quality improvements in those goods? If quality goes up and price stays same, is that deflation?

As you can see, it's not just take the Consumer Price Index and be done with it. In fact, the US Fed doesn't officially use the CPI, opting for another Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index instead \[2\]. 

Maybe inflation's like the tide - [tide goes in, tide goes out, you can't explain that.](https://www.newser.com/story/109164/bill-oreilly-to-atheists-you-cant-explain-the-tides.html "tide")
