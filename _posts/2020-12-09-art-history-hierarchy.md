## Main

December's a convenient time to do reflections. Like prior years, I'll be doing a more comprehensive reflection on the year in the monthly post \[1\]. I'll spend the weeklies highlighting new topics I've learnt about this year.

First up is art history. I started spending more time learning about art this year, due to a few factors:

- Covid cancelled a lot of my hobbies
- I've always been curious about art, and believe it still has relevance today 
- Art is much better when you have context for the piece

I found [Smarthistory](https://smarthistory.org/) to be an approachable yet comprehensive website, and have been working through many of the pages. Reading about the intentions behind famous pieces has made understanding the works easier and more enjoyable. For example, finally understanding what Picasso's about [in an earlier article I wrote](https://www.leonlinsx.com/picasso/ "picasso") 

With that in mind, let's take a look at three pieces with a similar theme, and see how the context of history can give us a better understanding of what the artist was trying to do.

Above we see three reclining nudes, a popular subject for artists for a long time \[2\]. In clockwise order we have a Titian from the 1500s, a Dominique-Ingres from the early 1800s, and a Manet from later 1800s. All of these artists were famous then, and still are now. "Venus" was fairly uncontroversial during its time, but the other two "La Grande Odalisque” and “Olympia” attracted much more criticism. Why? 

To answer that question, it'll be helpful to understand the [hierarchy of art genres](http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/hierarchy-of-genres.htm "hierarchy") that people had adhered to for centuries:

Yep, for a long time the type of your art would have a certain "rank," and people would automatically judge a painting of still lifes as less important compared to a painting of a religious scene. Not entirely surprising, considering that the church was a big patron of art in historical times.

Let's take a closer look at Venus and the thought that Titian put behind the composition. [Venus was probably intended as a marriage gift](https://smarthistory.org/titian-venus-of-urbino/ "venus") to the couple for private viewing \[3\], the hairstyle being typical of brides for that time, and the roses associated with love. Being titled Venus, it was also meant to be a mythological painting, firmly putting it in the top "rank" of art for that time.

To make the painting more interesting visually, Titian's also contrasted the curve of the body, against the straight lines of the background. Also notice how the black lines also direct our attention to the figure. The red lines in the background are not entirely parallel by intention, as this creates [perspective](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/perspective "perspective") for the image and makes it appear more 3D.

Now let's look at Odalisque (which means concubine) and see what's stayed the same and what's changed. The subject is of course the first thing that comes to mind. Besides that, the similar use of skin tone on Odalisque and Venus makes them both seem lifelike. 

Dominique-Ingres has added more detail to the foreground, such as the peacock feathers or the gems. A key difference is that he doesn't use as many straight lines for contrast or perspective. Instead, the painting's all about the curves:

If you stare at the body long enough, you'll also start feeling that something's strange. The body's elongated through the pose, for sure, but doesn't it seem quite a bit *too* long? The figure's proportions aren't quite right. If you look at the left leg of the figure, you'll also realise that wherever it attaches to in the body is also off. These were intentional constructions by Ingres, in order to make the viewer get the sense that the body is long and
