## Main

Decemeber's a convenient time to do reflections. I'll be doing a more comprehensive reflection on the year in the monthly post, and will be spending a few weeks highlighting some new topics I've learnt about this year.

First up is art history. I started spending more time learning about art this year, due to a few factors:

- Covid cancelled a lot of my hobbies
- I've always been curious about art, and believe it still has relevance today 
- Art is much better when you have context for the piece
