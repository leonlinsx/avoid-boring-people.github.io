**Better forecasting**

We see people make predictions all the time, from finance to economics to politics. And although most of these forecasts and forecasters end up wrong, we continue to listen to them \[1\]. Are there people that can reliably forecast then? [This article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/06/how-to-predict-the-future/588040/ "atlantic article") focusing on Philip Tetlock's \[2\] work on the subject claims there are:

> Reliable insight into the future is possible, however. It just requires a style of thinking that’s uncommon among experts who are certain that their deep knowledge has granted them a special grasp of what is to come.

The article starts with an anecdote about Paul Ehrlich and Julian Simon's errors, and goes on to detail Philip's work:

> Tetlock decided to put expert political and economic predictions to the test. With the Cold War in full swing, he collected forecasts from 284 highly educated experts who averaged more than 12 years of experience in their specialties. \[...\] The project lasted 20 years, and comprised 82,361 probability estimates about the future.

> The result: The experts were, by and large, horrific forecasters. Their areas of specialty, years of experience, and (for some) access to classified information made no difference.

Because of the lack of accountability in forecasting, incentives are skewed towards making extreme predictions. If you're wrong, people will forget. If you're right, you get to ride the success of your one big call even years down the road. This is easy to see in some high profile hedge fund managers, who made their fortune on trades that seemed genius in hindsight but have struggled since. As Paul Samuelson was quoted, "The stock market has forecast nine of the last five recessions."

> One subgroup of scholars, however, did manage to see more of what was coming. \[...\] They took from each argument and integrated apparently contradictory worldviews. \[...\] The integrators outperformed their colleagues in pretty much every way, but especially trounced them on long-term predictions. Eventually, Tetlock bestowed nicknames (borrowed from the philosopher Isaiah Berlin) on the experts he’d observed: The highly specialized hedgehogs knew “one big thing,” while the integrator foxes knew “many little things.”

Some of you might have seen this fox vs hedgehog comparison before. It's somewhat similar to the [specialists vs generalists](https://www.leonlinsx.com/specialists-vs-generalists/) framework I've commented on before. However, though foxes are supposedly better at predicting, I still think that you generally get rewarded more for being a hedgehog. The perception of ability might be more important than having ability.

> Tetlock and Mellers found that not only were the best forecasters foxy as individuals, but they tended to have qualities that made them particularly effective collaborators. They were “curious about, well, really everything,” as one of the top forecasters told me. They crossed disciplines, and viewed their teammates as sources for learning, rather than peers to be convinced.

I've met plenty of people that believe they're open-minded, saying they prefer getting to the truth rather than being right. Most of the investing community believes they have this mindset, since it's almost a necessity to make money over time. Here's something to think about though: What's the last major thing you've changed your mind about? If, like me, it's hard to come up with a good example, perhaps we're not as open-minded as we thought... \[3\]

**Footnotes**
1. Some famous quotes [here](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Incorrect_predictions) and [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/05/the-big-question/389582/) showing how predicting the future is hard, even for people who are experts in their field. I'm listing this not to shame; I'd probably have been even more wrong in their situation.
2. Naturally, there are critics of Philip's work, with Nassim Taleb being a particularly outspoken one. Both have published books and tweeted about their work, if you're interested in digging in further.
3. I'm not saying you should change your mind all the time. But it is remarkable the number of people who will claim they have 'strong opinions, weakly held' that also can't say the last time they've had a change in opinion that mattered.
