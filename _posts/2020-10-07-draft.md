## Predicting history

We live in historic times.

Do we really though? Put another way, would you know whether an event is historic or not, while you're living through it?

The paper ["Predicting history"](https://www.gwern.net/docs/history/2019-risi.pdf "predict") \[1\] makes the claims that:

- many events that will one day be viewed as historic attract little attention at the time
- machine learning models show increasing, rather than decreasing error rates the more data they're given to predict
- there are limits to predictability in complex social systems, and historical significance is difficult to predict

The paper's a short six pages, but rather dense, so I'm going to just pull out the highlights and give more context to their conclusions.

They start by giving an anecdote:

> Danto imagined a hypothetical entity—the ideal chronicler—that possesses complete information about the state of the world, along with its entire history up to that point, and unlimited ability to integrate and analyse that information. 

How would this chronicler fare on judging if an event was significant?

> Danto then argued that the ideal chronicler would still be unable to anticipate the significance that will be assigned to contemporaneous events by future historians because their judgements are inevitably informed by events that have not yet taken place.

This is a strong claim to make, since many events seem to be "easily" classified as historic:

> One can also easily think of other events, such as Einstein’s formulation of special relativity, the moon landing, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA, that were immediately hailed as historic and continue to be viewed that way decades later

To formulate the problem in a way that's conducive for a hypothesis, the team then looked at a collection of US Department of State records \[2\]. They scored each record based on how important historians at the time would have viewed that event, and how important historians now view that event.

## Footnotes

1. By Joseph Risi, Amit Sharma, Rohan Shah, Matthew Connelly, Duncan Watts. h/t [Josh Wolfe](https://twitter.com/wolfejosh?s=20 "Josh")
2. Specifically, they used a now declassified collection of 1,952,029 state department cables from [1973-1979](http://history-lab.org/cables "cable"), treating each cable as a single event. Cables were the main form of communicating important information then, and while the dataset only captures a small bit of all international events, the team thought it should capture any important US events. The majority of cables were also unimportant matters, giving more data to work with for the hypothesis.
