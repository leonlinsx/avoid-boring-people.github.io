## Predicting history

We live in historic times.

Do we really though? Put another way, how would you know whether an event is historic or not, while you're living through it?

The paper ["Predicting history"](https://www.gwern.net/docs/history/2019-risi.pdf "predict") \[1\] makes the claims that:

- many events that will one day be viewed as historic attract little attention at the time
- machine learning models show increasing, rather than decreasing error rates the more data they're given to predict
- there are limits to predictability in complex social systems, and historical significance is difficult to predict
