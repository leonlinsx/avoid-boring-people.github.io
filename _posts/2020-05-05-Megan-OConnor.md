**Main**

[Human Ventures](https://humanventures.co/about-us "Human") is an NYC based [startup incubator and VC fund](https://www.fastcompany.com/90311721/exclusive-human-ventures-elevates-its-woman-led-startup-studio-with-a-50-million-debut-fund "VC"), bringing together founders to build a company before deciding whether to invest in them \[1\]. 

Recently, they hosted an Ask Me Anything (AMA) of [Megan O'Connor](https://twitter.com/meganmoconnor?lang=en "Megan"), one of their founders. Megan was previously founder of [Clark](https://www.hiclark.com/ "Clark") tutoring and currently Entrepreneur in Residence at Kaplan; clearly experienced in the education space \[2\]. Notes below cover the following areas:


**Dealing with the present**

- What are some lessons we're learning about schooling from home \[3\]?
  - the biggest lesson learnt is the difference in access
    - not all families are set up to be schooled from home. They need access to broadband, devices, and a space to learn. Most of those came at a delay
    - we all assume that students have access to internet, devices, spaces they can learn in, but that's not the situation for most students
    - had to get chromebooks and other devices to students, had to have broadband providers figuring out how to get places connected
  - the second lesson is the difference in platforms used by various schools
    - huge divide among schools and students in terms of getting platforms up and running to interact with students digitally
    - schools with snow day plans in place were the most prepared
    - if you weren't already on an information system that had parent/student contact info, and parent/students socialised at using that, it could take **three weeks or more to see attendance improve**
    - in some schools up to 25% of students haven't engaged with the online work yet

- What are some problems with schooling from home?
  - it's easy to get distracted
  - students need to process info in digestible units. Taking reference from the 7 min rule from massive open online course (MOOCs) and coursera \[4\], we now need to teach in bite sized pieces of information vs longer lessons in person
  - parents are also getting involved in children's learning out of necessity

- How can parents have sustainable work and teaching lives?
  - the state we're in now is unsustainable. Working and home schooling in this form is unsustainable
  - a leading interrupter for meetings now is children asking how to get to the next step in their lessons
  - we'll start to see things on how to keep kids engaged for longer
  - it's a tall order now to ask teachers to make sure kids know what to do next, and to do that in a sustainable way. 
  - this is where we see there's a place for software to help with gamification, notifications, triggers, or more to help kids maintain attention
  - this is potentially a way to test cohort based learning as well, by having students do different material based on their level
  
*LL - The part about access, as usual, harms the people that would benefit from education the most. [As linked in my previous post, the lower income groups are likely to suffer most from covid](https://twitter.com/michaelxpettis/status/1253217553083707393 "Pettis"). The cohort based learning is interesting, since that's theoretically a scalable way of teaching to everyone's level and ensuring your brightest don't feel bored and your weakest don't get left behind.*
  
**Future of education tech**

- How will schools teach the emotional aspect of growth if we move towards screen based learning?
  - computer based learning can teach you so much, but learning with other humans is important. You grow through social interaction, and that is why we send people to school in person
  - there's already some great curriculm on this e.g. [Move this world](https://www.movethisworld.com/ "move") \[5\]
  - and I think we're going to find social and emotional learning becoming an important subject of its own, and more of a focal point than it was before
  
*LL - Education is not just about learning lessons, learning how to learn, or status signalling. While it includes all of those and more, the socialisation aspect is also important. Josh Wolfe touches on the daycare aspect of schooling in a talk I'll be summarising later this week as well.* 
  
- Do you think there's a bigger place for online learning permanently?
  - the cool thing that's going to happen is it's going to more personalised and self-paced after this
  - this will allow students to know what skils they have, and map their assignments against their skills
  - you could tag what skills students are getting after a lesson, how it maps against the learning journey for that student, and what skills are relevant for future path and careers 
  - skills are more important than grades or scores  

*LL - I'm unclear if she meant that skills are going to be more important, or that they should be more important. Short of taking someon on a trial basis, it's hard to evaluate skills accurately. I'm more skeptical that online testing can solve this issue of tested skills vs actual ability*

- How do you see test taking evolve?
  - what will have the most radical shift from this is higher education
  - the focus of most people in high school is about how to get good SAT scores to get into a good college \[6\]
  - studetns will start thinking in terms of career paths, and how college fits or doesn't fit into that path
  - as people think about that tradeoff, test taking will lower in importance
  - test taking has quickly moved online, but the importance of test scores will change, and we'll start looking for other markers of students ability
  
*LL - Fred Wilson thought similarly about test taking moving online [in a prior post.](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/what-will-stick-and-what-will-not "test") I can't remember the exact history of college standardised testing, and do recall complaints that it's mainly an exploitation by the test administrating companies. I can't vouch for that accuracy, though I do understand the need for some sort of standardised measure to scalably admit or reject students*

- We've starting seeing people asking for refunds of college tuition. How do we get away from being focused on credentials? 
  - the reason we see people asking for refunds is because we say that online education is a lower value than in person
reason we do that is because less data at showing online less learning, assume less personaliisatiioin to 
How do we do personalisation, give best in class learning exp, have the best cinematography, best exp for students
dont think we move away from credential. if anything seeing that moving online too
even seeing that in engineering, ppl getting credentials
think we're going to see wild wet iin terms of credentialling, see huge boom in that
in same way we saw boom in organic labels, same here in skills credentialling

**Footnotes**

1. The startup incubator piece is usually (not always) separate from the venture investing side. You'll have an incubator that takes an equity share in the companies incubated but not others, or a VC firm that doesn't have the incubator and looks around for companies. Human Ventures says they "We collaborate with experienced founders in a dynamic environment to concept-test, validate, and build-out their next company. We then activate our deep network of other founders, advisors, investors, and talent to continue to support the founders throughout the life of the business." I'm unsure how different that is from a regular VC firm.
2. Megan has previously raised funding from [Lightspeed Ventures Partners, Winklevoss Capital, Rethink Education, and more](https://www.meganmoconnor.com/ "Megan")
3. They used "work from home" in the talk, and I've paraphrased since it's more of learning from home for the students. As always, I'll be paraphrasing throughout for clarity.
4. A massive open online course [is an online course aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the web.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course "wiki") Coursera is one such example.
5. "Move This World is a social emotional learning (SEL) program that uses interactive videos, movement, and creative expression to help students and educators develop emotional intelligence skills for long-term wellbeing."
6. For the non Americans, this is a pre-university standardised test, like the A-levels or IB.
