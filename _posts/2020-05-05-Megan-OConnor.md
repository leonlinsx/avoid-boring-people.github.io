**Main**

[Human Ventures](https://humanventures.co/about-us "Human") is an NYC based [startup incubator and VC fund](https://www.fastcompany.com/90311721/exclusive-human-ventures-elevates-its-woman-led-startup-studio-with-a-50-million-debut-fund "VC"), bringing together founders to build a company before deciding whether to invest in them \[1\]. 

Recently, they hosted an Ask Me Anything (AMA) of [Megan O'Connor](https://twitter.com/meganmoconnor?lang=en "Megan"), one of their founders. Megan was previously founder of [Clark](https://www.hiclark.com/ "Clark") tutoring and currently Entrepreneur in Residence at Kaplan, and experienced in the education space \[2\]. Notes below cover the following areas:



**Footnotes**

1. The startup incubator piece is usually (not always) separate from the venture investing side. You'll have an incubator that takes an equity share in the companies incubated but not others, or a VC firm that doesn't have the incubator and looks around for companies. Human Ventures says they "We collaborate with experienced founders in a dynamic environment to concept-test, validate, and build-out their next company. We then activate our deep network of other founders, advisors, investors, and talent to continue to support the founders throughout the life of the business." I'm unsure how different that is from a regular VC firm.
2. Megan has previously raised funding from [Lightspeed Ventures Partners, Winklevoss Capital, Rethink Education, and more](https://www.meganmoconnor.com/ "Megan")
