**Main**

[Human Ventures](https://humanventures.co/about-us "Human") is an NYC based [startup incubator and VC fund](https://www.fastcompany.com/90311721/exclusive-human-ventures-elevates-its-woman-led-startup-studio-with-a-50-million-debut-fund "VC"), bringing together founders to build a company before deciding whether to invest in them \[1\]. 

Recently, they hosted an Ask Me Anything (AMA) of [Megan O'Connor](https://twitter.com/meganmoconnor?lang=en "Megan"), one of their founders. Megan was previously founder of [Clark](https://www.hiclark.com/ "Clark") tutoring and currently Entrepreneur in Residence at Kaplan; clearly experienced in the education space \[2\]. Notes below cover the following areas:


**Dealing with the present**

- What are some lessons we're learning about schooling from home \[3\]?
  - the biggest lesson learnt is the difference in access
    - not all families are set up to be schooled from home. They need access to broadband, devices, and a space to learn. Most of those came at a delay
    - we all assume that students have access to internet, devices, spaces they can learn in, but that's not the situation for most students
    - had to get chromebooks and other devices to students, had to have broadband providers figuring out how to get places connected
  - the second lesson is the difference in platforms used by various schools
    - huge divide among schools and students in terms of getting platforms up and running to interact with students digitally
    - schools with snow day plans in place were the most prepared
    - if you weren't already on an information system that had parent/student contact info, and parent/students socialised at using that, it could take **three weeks or more to see attendance improve**
    - in some schools up to 25% of students haven't engaged with the online work yet

- What are some problems with schooling from home?
  - it's easy to get distracted
  - students need to process info in digestible units. Taking reference from the 7 min rule from massive open online course (MOOCs) and coursera \[4\], we now need to teach in bite sized pieces of info vs longer lessons in person
  - parents are also getting involved in children's learning out of necessity

**Footnotes**

1. The startup incubator piece is usually (not always) separate from the venture investing side. You'll have an incubator that takes an equity share in the companies incubated but not others, or a VC firm that doesn't have the incubator and looks around for companies. Human Ventures says they "We collaborate with experienced founders in a dynamic environment to concept-test, validate, and build-out their next company. We then activate our deep network of other founders, advisors, investors, and talent to continue to support the founders throughout the life of the business." I'm unsure how different that is from a regular VC firm.
2. Megan has previously raised funding from [Lightspeed Ventures Partners, Winklevoss Capital, Rethink Education, and more](https://www.meganmoconnor.com/ "Megan")
3. They used "work from home" in the talk, and I've paraphrased since it's more of learning from home for the students. As always, I'll be paraphrasing throughout for clarity.
4. A massive open online course [is an online course aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the web.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course "wiki") Coursera is one such example.
