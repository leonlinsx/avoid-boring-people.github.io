I've found John Huber's categorisation of investment edge indispensable in thinking about investing. He recently wrote more about it [here](http://sabercapitalmgt.com/black-edge/ "Edge")

> Everyone understands that there is no info edge in Facebook or Apple. But there isn’t any info edge in smaller stocks either, at least not in a meaningful way that can be reliably utilized. 

> I’ve observed over the years that whatever information an investor believes to be unique is almost always understood by many other market participants, and thus is not valuable. The mispricing is not in the stock itself, but in the investor’s own perception of the value of information:

> investment decisions were made that had nothing to do with long-term value and everything to do with short-term stock price.

> it solidifies two things that I already am very convinced of:

> First, I have no informational edge, I don’t think anyone else has one either. But I don’t think you need one. 

> Second, the investor who is willing to look out three or four years will have a lasting edge because \[...\] the deterioration of the info edge has actually increased the size of the “time horizon” edge.

> The time horizon edge could be summed up this way: the price of gaining this edge is the volatility that could occur in the near term.
