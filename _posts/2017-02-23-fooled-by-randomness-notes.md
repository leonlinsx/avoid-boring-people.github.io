\* *Note: this is a backdated post from notes I took on Taleb's book in the past*

I read Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book 'Fooled by Randomness' a while back and thought it was great. Below are my notes and thoughts:

1. "In expectation, a dentist is richer than a rock star."
  * You cannot consider the success of a profession without taking into account the average of all the people who enter it. Do not just include the sample that succeeded. Take into account both the observed and unobserved possible outcomes to get a full picture

2. "A mistake is not something to be determined after the fact, but in light of information until that point. People overestimate what they knew at the time of the event due to subsequent information (hindsight bias)

o   Ergodicity. Under certain conditions, very long sample paths end up resembling each other

o   Scaling property of randomness is misunderstood. Assume 15% return w/ 10% std dev, translates to 93% probability of success in a year, but 50% per second (need to check how calculated)

§  Over a short time increment, one observes the variability of the portfolio, not the returns

§  Our emotions are not designed to understand this point

o   Traits shared by people fooled by randomness

§  Overestimation of the accuracy of their beliefs in some econ/stat measure

§  Tendency to get married to positions

§  Tendency to change their story

§  No precise game plan ahead of time on what to do in event of losses

§  Absence of critical thinking when revising their stance; Denial

o   Evolution means that on average animals will be fit, but not every single one of them, and not at all times

§  Worse still, the longer the animal goes w/o encountering the rare event, the more vulnerable they will be to it

o   He tries to benefit from skewed bets. Rare events that do not repeat frequently, but present large payoff when they occur

o   There are only 2 types of theories:

§  Theories that are known to be wrong, falsified

§  Theories that have not yet been known to be wrong

§  A theory cannot be verified

o   Real randomness does not look random

o   Option traders in 2 categories:

§  Premium sellers sell options, make steady money, blow up occasionally

§  Premium buyers do the reverse

o   Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence

o   Distribution of the maximum of variables – the max of an average is less volatile than the average maximum

o   We do not understand confidence levels. Activity in the market should depend less on where a variable is going to go and more the confidence interval

o   His epiphany came when he understood he was not intelligent nor strong enough to fight emotions, but intelligent enough to understand he has predisposition to be fooled by randomness

o   There is nothing wrong and/undignified w/ emotions, but what is wrong is not following the dignified path.
