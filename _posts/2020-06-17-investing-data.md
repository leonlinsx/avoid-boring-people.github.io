        overflow: hidden;

      .iframe-container iframe { 
         border: 0;
         height: 100%; <!-- Finally, width and height are set to 100% so the iframe takes up 100% of the containers space. -->

### Main

Last week, we looked at [how companies use machine learning to take data, process it, and come to a conclusion.](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/the-next-machine-learning-startup "ML") 

This week, we'll look at a more human oriented process, by walking through how analysts at an investment firm obtain data, analyse it, and form a thesis. I'll be doing this from a typical [long/short fundamental hedge fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long/short_equity "LS") point of view, rather than a quantitative firm \[1\]. 

My goal is for you as a retail investor to have a better understanding of the edge that professionals have, and what that implies on the edge that you can have \[2\].

### Footnotes

1. Note that an investment firm like a hedge fund is different from an investment bank; most investment analysts do compeletely different jobs than investment bankers. [Sellside equity research is the role most similar to a hedge fund analyst, but researchers don't actually invest money](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/you-dont-want-quality-time-you-want "Sellside")
2. Edge here refers to the relative advantage you have against your competition. We discussed [why this was important in investing last month](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/relatively-speaking-the-billionaire "edge")
