[I've written before about doing year end reflections](https://www.leonlinsx.com/2018-year-end-reflection/ "2018 reflection"). For 2019, I've updated the questions and [made a new template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iGZJxnCs91LsHSnOK-C5ACq5SS50PEWRqCMnt2fXVY0/edit?usp=sharing "new template") based on other helpful articles I saw. I adapted the content and format from [Steve Schlafman
 and Howard Gray here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ais6wP0HxoFfvHR9JVkf2sw2ft_EUBtb42JYOr6ObGo/edit "template"), and also included helpful advice from [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WxAY5ujUeKKQ_Y1c-Ic_rHj2t3Kaw_GOpwTX1jY4y_k/edit?usp=sharing "template"), [Kelly Thorne Gore](https://ibloom.us/blog/10-end-of-the-year-reflection-questions/ "questions"), and [Henna Inam](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hennainam/2018/12/31/ten-questions-to-ask-in-your-personal-year-end-review/#1a0297287e7d "questions"). Note that this is the template that I find helpful for myself, and may not be the template most helpful for you; feel free to adjust as needed. 
 
The template can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iGZJxnCs91LsHSnOK-C5ACq5SS50PEWRqCMnt2fXVY0/edit?usp=sharing "template") and my completed example [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iSrugAAQ9baLTXvh7Ck6YO7MUCB8CbQQqyEX8BMiUv0/edit?usp=sharing "public"). Below I'll cover the rationale for the structure and some of the questions.

The overall intent is to:
  - get an overview of the past year (step 1)
  - then look deeper into things that worked, didn't work, and why (step 2)
  - understand the key learnings and how you've changed (step 3)
  - understand how you feel at this moment (step 4)
  - know what you need to do for the next year (step 5)

Question rationale:

- What were my successes? 
  - Start out on a positive note. Many people stress over failure, but you need to celebrate your wins as well and take credit for better mental health
  
- What obstacles did I overcome?
  - Success isn't easy, so knowing what difficulties you had in getting there will let you better appreciate your success and also serve as reference for the next time you're planning
  
- What healthy habits have I picked up?
  - Your habits shape the person you are, both good and bad ones. [James Clear wrote a book about this](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits "Atomic") that people seem to like
  
- What risks did I take?
  - I personally don't take enough risk, and also assume people are risk-averse on average. This question is to reflect on how you've gotten out of your comfort zone and tried to grow. [I'm trying to take more asymmetric risk this year.](https://twitter.com/Leonlinsx/status/1212971688478101504?s=20 "twitter")
  
- What did I procrastinate on?
  - You can fail by not doing enough of something; procrastination is a topic [I've written about before](https://www.leonlinsx.com/procrastinate-another-way/ "procrastinate") and still struggle with

- What did I spend too much time or effort on?
  - You can also fail by doing too much. Learning to let go is important
  
- Who should I be thankful for?
  - Broadly speaking, anything you're thankful for is a result of someone doing something for you e.g hiring you, befriending you, cooking a great meal etc. We don't give thanks and appreciation often enough so the year end is a good excuse to do so
  
- What relationships had a negative impact on my life?
  - Not all relationships are worth maintaining. The first step is understanding which ones are unhealthy.
  
- Of those, what are my top goals?
  - It's helpful to write down all your goals just to see what you're looking forward to next year. However, having too many goals leads to lack of focus.
  
- What do I need to achieve my goals?
  - There are many resources on how to set goals that work e.g SMART goals, having a buddy, focusing on intent etc. Find the one that works for you, and note the thing you need personally to keep you accountable.

- What should I let go?
  - People like starting new things such as new year resolutions, but often don't look at what they need to leave behind. [Empty your cup](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/48714-empty-your-cup-so-that-it-may-be-filled-become "bruce") 
  
Thanks again to Steve Schlafman and Howard Gray for the original template that mine heavily draws from, plus Anne-Laure Le Cunff, Kelly Thorne Gore, and Henna Inam for the additional questions.
