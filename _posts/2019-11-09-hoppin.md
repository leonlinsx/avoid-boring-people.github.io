I recently job shadowed [Bilyana Freye](https://twitter.com/bilyanafreye?lang=en "Billy") of the job shadowing marketplace [Hoppin](https://gohoppin.com/ "Hoppin"), below is an inital take on my experience. I'll be adding more to this next week.

*Full disclosure: My company paid for this activity as part of a professional growth learning budget \[1\]*

I'll start off describing the booking flow, then my personal experience, and end with thoughts and feedback on the company.

**Booking flow**

The site has search functionality to let you browse for experiences in your area of interest

After choosing an experience you're interested in, you're brought to a profile of the person and the experience. In this example \[2\], you can see brief info about the role, duration, location etc above the fold, and then more details below it.

After you click through to book, you can select your interests from a prepopulated list, which was provided by the host.

You then select dates that work for you:

And you can give free-form responses about your intent after that. Side thought - perhaps this can be combined with the 'select your interests section'? Seems to be of similar purpose

The next step is to fill in your contact info and any other social media profiles you want to link. Here you see them pulling in info that I'd previously filled in my profile for convenience

Hoppin is trying to pivot to B2B, hence this next step of coupon application. It wasn't there when I initially made my booking a few weeks prior.

The final step is payment details. I've blacked out the numbers here since they're still working on pricing. I personally would prefer seeing the price upfront, on the experiences page itself, but can understand why it's here in the flow

You get a confirmation email after the booking, and supposedly a receipt as well \[3\]. After that, they send a reminder email the week of, and also an email prompt the day of to nudge you to share your experience.

In addition to that, I also got an email from my host (Bilyana, the founder) with my agenda. I found this helpful to ease my concerns about what to expect. I also thought it was awesome that she'd clearly arranged for an experience that fit what I was interested in. The Hoppin team mentioned they're intending for the host to reach out first since the host is getting paid; the team intends to make that more obvious to the hosts moving forward.

**Footnotes**
1. Also, Hoppin bought me lunch. I'll leave you to decide if that affects my objectivity...
2. I forgot to take screenshots during my actual booking, so these are mostly a re-creation
3. Might have been a bug during my booking as I didn't get my receipt. Hoppin told me they're looking into it.
