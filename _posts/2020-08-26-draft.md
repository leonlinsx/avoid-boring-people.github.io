### Process vs product

If you were asked to compare the object on the left vs the object on the right, what points would you make?

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Process 1.png)

One of the first things you'd notice would be the material. The left is made of stone, the right of bronze.

You might also mention the stone arrowhead is likely not as sharp as the bronze, is probably less durable, and asymmetrical.

What you inferred but probably didn't state explicitly would be that the manufacturing process for these two items is different too. Stone requires cutting, but bronze requires smelting. 

Focusing on this topic of process, [Michael Filler and Matthew Realff propose that Fundamental Manufacturing Process Innovation (FMPI) is central to progress.](https://medium.com/@processinnovation/fundamental-manufacturing-process-innovation-changes-the-world-471adcc77c48 "FMPI") Let's see what they mean by FMPI, why it's important, and how we can incentivise more of it.

The authors propose that there are improvements in processes that have resulted in large visible progress for mankind. However, people overlook the changes in the intangible process, and overly focus on the changes in the physical product instead. In our arrowhead example above, people focus on the stone vs bronze outcome, without looking at the cutting vs smelting process improvement \[1\]. These high impact process innovations are what they call FMPI.

Researching FMPI is important because if you can quantify the various methods that have led to progress for humanity, you have an alternative framework of getting better. For example, knowing that assembly lines get more efficiency by factoring a process into sequential parts is helpful for seeing where else you could apply the same technique.

The practical implication on this for your daily life is to review all the recurring processes that you participate in. Whether that's at work or at a hobby, try and see if there's a way to rearrange the steps such that your processes are more effective:

- If there's a repetitive process involving transferring data from one software to another, [zapier](https://zapier.com/ "zapier") might be able to automate that
- If you're always having to teach other people how to do stuff, [scribe](https://cursive.io/scribe "scribe") might be able to reduce your workload
- If you've always done something by default, maybe filming yourself and reviewing all the steps in the process visually will help

Below, we'll look into the different steps in process improvements, and see examples of innovations that were due to FMPI. 

#### FMPI occurs through eight schemas

They define process as a connected series of steps, that transform an initial state into some other state. Re-arrangement of the steps can result in process improvement. 'Steps' are the building blocks of processes, and rearranging steps can get you more effective processes.

The authors propose 8 types (schemas) of process improvements:

Parallelization (type 1) refers to multiple instances of the same step being simultaneously carried out.

If you have parallelization, that implies you can split steps (type 2) and merge steps (type 3)

If you split a step and send the parts to diffferent downstream steps, that's known as separation (type 4)

You can combine multiple steps (type 5) or factor a step into multiple ones (type 6) \[2\]

Lastly, you can remove things by being subtractive (type 7) or add things by being additive (type 8)

By using various variations of the 8 types above, you can change the way you do things for the better. Let's look at more concrete examples.

**Footnotes**

1. They propose 3 reasons for this: a) Process has a fleeting nature, and is more transient than product b) Process improvement has a large breath of application, and is easily missed by specialised practitioners (unsure what they meant here) c) Process is thought to be just a rearrangement of steps, a trivial activity 
2. Factoring seems awfully like separation to me, and I think the difference they want to make is separation goes to different downstream steps. Factoring goes to the same step
