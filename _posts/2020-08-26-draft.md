        padding-top: 50%; <!-- Calculated from the aspect ration of the content (in case of 16:9 it is 9/16= 0.5625) -->
        position: relative;

      .iframe-container iframe { 
         border: 0;
         height: 100%; <!-- Finally, width and height are set to 100% so the iframe takes up 100% of the containers space. -->

### Process vs product

If you were asked to compare the object on the left vs the object on the right, what points would you make?

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Process 1.png)

One of the first things you'd notice would be the material. The left is made of stone, the right of bronze.

You might also mention the stone arrowhead is likely not as sharp as the bronze, is probably less durable, and asymmetrical.

What you inferred but probably didn't state explicitly would be that the manufacturing process for these two items is different too. Stone requires cutting, but bronze requires smelting. 

Focusing on this topic of process, [Michael Filler and Matthew Realff propose that Fundamental Manufacturing Process Innovation (FMPI) is central to progress.](https://medium.com/@processinnovation/fundamental-manufacturing-process-innovation-changes-the-world-471adcc77c48 "FMPI") Let's see what they mean by FMPI, why it's important, and how we can incentivise more of it.

The authors propose that there are improvements in processes that have resulted in large visible progress for mankind. However, people overlook the changes in the intangible process, and overly focus on the changes in the physical product instead. In our arrowhead example above, people focus on the stone vs bronze outcome, without looking at the cutting vs smelting process improvement \[1\]. These high impact process innovations are what they call FMPI.

The practical implication on this for your daily life is to review all the recurring processes that you participate in. Whether that's at work or at a hobby, try and see if there's a way to rearrange the steps such that your processes are more effective:

- If there's a repetitive process involving transferring data from one software to another, [zapier](https://zapier.com/ "zapier") might be able to automate that
- If you're always having to teach other people how to do stuff, [scribe](https://cursive.io/scribe "scribe") might be able to reduce your workload
- If you've always done something by default, maybe filming yourself and reviewing all the steps in the process visually will help

Below, we'll look into the different steps in process improvements, and see examples of innovations that were due to FMPI. 

#### FMPI occus through eight schemas

They define process as a connected series of steps, that transform an initial state into some other state. Re-arrangement of the steps can result in process improvement.

types of process

Parallelization (schema I) allows multiple instances of the same step to be simultaneously carried out. To enable parallelization, flows of material to and from process steps may be split (schema II) or merged (schema III). A separation (schema IV) occurs when flows are selectively partitioned to send entities with different properties to different downstream process steps. Multiple process steps may be combined (schema V) or individual process steps may be factored (schema VI). Note that the simultaneous use of schema V and VI results in refactoring, where process steps are first factored and then combined in new ways. Process steps may themselves change from being subtractive (schema VII) to additive (schema VIII)

**Footnotes**

1. They propose 3 reasons for this: a) Process has a fleeting nature, and is more transient than product b) Process improvement has a large breath of application, and is easily missed by specialised practitioners (unsure what they meant here) b) Process is thought to be just a rearrangement of steps, a trivial activity
