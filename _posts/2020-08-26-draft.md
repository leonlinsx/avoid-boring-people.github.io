### Main

[Michael Filler and Matthew Realff propose that Fundamental Manufacturing Process Innovation (FMPI) is central to progress.](https://medium.com/@processinnovation/fundamental-manufacturing-process-innovation-changes-the-world-471adcc77c48 "FMPI") Let's see what they mean by FMPI, why it's important, and how we can incentivise more of it.

The authors propose that there are improvements in processes that have resulted in large visible progress for mankind. However, people overlook the changes in the intangible process, and overly focus on the changes in the physical product instead. 

For example, a bronze arrowhead is a different product than a stone arrowhead, but the process to create both is different as well, as bronze requires smelting but stone requires cutting. People focus on the stone vs bronze, without looking at the cutting vs smelting improvement. \[1\]

These high impact process innovations are what they call FMPI. The authors look into breaking down the different steps that occur in FMPI improvements, and give examples of innovations that were due to FMPI.

#### FMPI occus through eight schemas

They define process as a connected series of steps, that transform an initial state into some other state. Re-arrangement of the steps can result in process improvement.

types of process

Parallelization (schema I) allows multiple instances of the same step to be simultaneously carried out. To enable parallelization, flows of material to and from process steps may be split (schema II) or merged (schema III). A separation (schema IV) occurs when flows are selectively partitioned to send entities with different properties to different downstream process steps. Multiple process steps may be combined (schema V) or individual process steps may be factored (schema VI). Note that the simultaneous use of schema V and VI results in refactoring, where process steps are first factored and then combined in new ways. Process steps may themselves change from being subtractive (schema VII) to additive (schema VIII)

**Footnotes**

1. They propose 3 reasons for this: a) Process has a fleeting nature, and is more transient than product b) Process improvement has a large breath of application, and is easily missed by specialised practitioners (unsure what they meant here) b) Process is thought to be just a rearrangement of steps, a trivial activity
