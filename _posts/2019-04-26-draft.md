*\*This is an adapted post from my email newsletter*\*

I have mixed thoughts about minimum wage laws and unpaid internships. https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2019/04/meer-on-minimum-wage.html

**Miscellaneous**
1. ["He took great pains not to mislead or confuse children, and his team of writers joked that his on-air manner of speaking amounted to a distinct language they called “Freddish.” Fundamentally, Freddish anticipated the ways its listeners might misinterpret what was being said."](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/mr-rogers-neighborhood-talking-to-kids/562352/ "Mr Rogers")

**Footnotes**
10. It seems within his rights to sell it, but I'd rather he not pretend on the ebay page he's 'opening this up to the world' rather than just trying to make money off it. 
11. With most engagement rates for those channels falling <5%, it's no wonder everyone's reluctant to respond to this newsletter... Sidenote, are any of you actually instagram famous? 
12. I'm not an advocator of the delete facebook trend but assume some of you might. I think there's value in using it, but as with most things you need to be aware of how you use it. It would be significantly more difficult for me to host events without it.
13. Character from the Avengers movie, if you weren't aware.
