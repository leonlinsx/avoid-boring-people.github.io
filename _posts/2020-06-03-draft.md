### Takeaway

We draw our beliefs from others but are ultimately responsible for them ourselves.

### Main

**We aren't born with our beliefs.**

We grow into them over time, influenced by our experiences. 

It's fun to debate [nature vs nurture](https://www.simplypsychology.org/naturevsnurture.html "nature"), biology vs behaviourism, [genes vs epigenetics](https://www.whatisepigenetics.com/what-is-epigenetics/ "epigenetics"), but what we believe and [how we behave](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0143110918/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1 "behave") is unquestionably influenced by others.

**We aren't sure what our beliefs are either.**

We have a small set of strong beliefs, and a large set of vague ones.

It's worth trying to write down all your core beliefs, the issues you feel most strongly about, your raison d'etre. If you're like me, [your list likely doesn't extend much beyond 20 items](https://www.leonlinsx.com/about-me/ "me") \[1\]. Yet, based on that short list of ideals, we have to make decisions in reality.

**We aren't making decisions on just our beliefs alone.**

We realise we don't live in a simple single person scenario, but a complex society of people.

We both influence and are influenced by the actions of others, and over time define [the cultural zeitgeist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist "zeit"). Since we're playing a relative status game, we need to consider what others believe. We behave in ways that we think will enhance our status in others' eyes. 

**Most of our time is then figuring out what others believe.**

In investing, we try to figure out [what market consensus is.](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/relatively-speaking-the-billionaire?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "cons") If you knew exactly where consensus was, you'd print money.

In tech, we try to figure out what customers desire. If you knew exactly what consumers would buy, you'd print money.

In life, we try to figure out what society demands. If you knew exactly what others wanted you to do, you'd print money.

"No way, I spend my time gathering evidence, I adjust my [bayesian priors the more information I get,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability "bayes") I'm a man of math"

If so, would evidence showing that more information increases your confidence, but not your accuracy, affect how strongly you hold your beliefs?

"No way, I'm an independent thinker, I don't care what others think, I'm a man of science"

There's less difference between you and someone who [believes in lizard people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptilian_conspiracy_theory "lizards") \[2\] 

Let's take something like the discovery of [the Higgs Boson](https://home.cern/science/physics/higgs-boson "Higgs"), a elementary particle in physics. As a man of science, you celebrated when you read the news that it was discovered. Another advancement for the ages.

How can you be so sure though? It's based on a news report, from conclusions of a paper, of a study in advanced physics that you're unlikely to understand, let alone replicate. Try as you might, you're not going to be able to build another Large Hadron Collider in your backyard \[3\]. You have to assume that what others believe is true.  

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Lizard people vs Higgs.png)

So that's the bad news. You're not much better than those of the lizard laity.

Here's the good news. You still get to decide what you believe in, changing that as you learn more than before. You're not fixed to any one opinion. The choice is yours, whether to change or be constant.

And while that does mean that people will hold beliefs that are harmful to themselves and to others, it also means that there's always hope that they can change. It's up to all of us to make that happen. [Nobody's born a racist;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QJIu15VjQg&feature=youtu.be&t=243 "racist") everybody can learn.

I want to believe.

### Footnotes

1. For those unaware, I have a personal site as well in case substack goes away. There's also other things I can post there like a list of websites I follow.
2. The phrasing for polls like this [can be bad](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/28/bush-did-north-dakota/ "poll"), but even if you haircut the numbers by 99% there is still > 1 person who seriously believes in a lizard king.
3. Well, if you somehow are able to build the next large particle accelerator in your backyard, I'd be happy to admit I'm wrong. You can even put my name down as the person who you had a bone to pick with and wanted to prove wrong.
