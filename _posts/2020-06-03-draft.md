      .iframe-container {
        overflow: hidden;        
        padding-top: 50%; <!-- Calculated from the aspect ration of the content (in case of 16:9 it is 9/16= 0.5625) -->
        position: relative;
      }
      .iframe-container iframe { 
         border: 0;
         height: 100%; <!-- Finally, width and height are set to 100% so the iframe takes up 100% of the containers space. -->

         top: 0;
         width: 100%;
         display: block;

### Main

We aren't born with our beliefs.

We grow into them over time, influenced by our experiences. 

It's fun to debate [nature vs nurture](https://www.simplypsychology.org/naturevsnurture.html "nature"), biology vs behaviourism, [genes vs epigenetics](https://www.whatisepigenetics.com/what-is-epigenetics/ "epigenetics"), but what we believe and [how we behave](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0143110918/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1 "behave") is unquestionably influenced by others.

We aren't sure what our beliefs are either.

We have a small set of strong beliefs, and a large set of vague ones.

It's worth trying to write down all your core beliefs, the issues you feel most strongly about, your raison d'etre. If you're like me, [your list likely doesn't extend much beyond 20 items](https://www.leonlinsx.com/about-me/ "me") \[1\]. Yet, based on that short list of ideals, we have to make decisions in reality. 

We then spend most of our time trying to figure out what others believe.

In investing, we try to figure out [what market consensus is.](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/relatively-speaking-the-billionaire?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "cons") If you knew exactly where consensus was, you'd print money.

In tech, we try to figure out what customers desire. If you knew exactly what consumers would buy, you'd print money.

In life, we try to figure out what society demands. If you knew exactly what others wanted you to do, you'd print money.

We're blinded by love, and we love our beliefs.
