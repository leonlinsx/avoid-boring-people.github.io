**Takeaways**


**How likely is likely**

> To ensure that report authors do not use ambiguous terms, both sets of guidelines \[by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the US Director of National Intelligence (DNI)\] provide a list of acceptable verbal probability phrases as well as their corresponding numeric probabilities. For example, an event described as “likely” in an IPCC report must have a 66% to 100% likelihood of occurring. On the other hand, an event described as “likely” in a DNI report must have a 55% to 80% likelihood. 

Overlap and effectiveness of guidance

> in general, numeric probabilities are precise but lack direction, whereas verbal probabilities have direction but lack precision

direction meaning positive or negative 

Having established the difference between numeric and verbal probabilities, the authors study how people combine these probabilities:

> we refer to participants using “averaging” or “counting” strategies when combining forecasts, 

> “averaging” to refer to a combination strategy by which the participant takes a weighted average of the advisors’ forecasts, placing their own forecast in between the advisors’ forecasts

>  “counting” to refer to a combination strategy by which participants interpret each of the advisors’ forecasts as a positive signal and adjust their own forecasts in the direction of the signal

To elaborate on the difference here: A forecast above the most extreme advisor’s forecasts is consistent with a counting strategy, but not with an averaging strategy. 

What did they find?

>  We find that, although people average multiple numeric forecasts, they “count” multiple verbal probability forecasts, resulting in forecasts that are more extreme than each advisor’s forecast

Why would this be important? If it affected how you actually behaved. Hence their next study: 

> Study 4 demonstrates that these different strategies influence subsequent consumer decisions
