**Takeaways**

1.

3. We're bad at describing probabilities and even worse at combining them

**How likely is likely**

If I tell you:

  - An expert says it's likely I quit my job to be Jameela Jamil's exclusive bartender \[30\]
  - A second expert also says it's likely
  
Would you think that it's "likely" or "highly likely" that this occurs?

What if:

  - The first expert says there's an 80% chance of the above happening
  - The second expert says there's an 70% chance
  
What would you think is the probability of this happening now? And would you say that is "likely?" "Highly likely?" 

[This paper by Celia Gaertig and Robert Mislavsky](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3454796 "paper") discusses how people combine probability predictions from multiple sources, by conducting experiments similar to the above. If you've been reading this newsletter for a while, it should not be a surprise that we're inconsistent in our judgement and combination of probabilities \[31\]. 

We all treat verbal and numerical probabilities differently; organisations and people have differing ideas of how likely "likely" is:

> an event described as “likely” in an IPCC \[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\] report must have a 66% to 100% likelihood of occurring. On the other hand, an event described as “likely” in a DNI \[US Director of National Intelligence\] report must have a 55% to 80% likelihood. 

And of course, if you polled your friends on their definition of "likely", [you'd get such a wide range of answers it'd be unhelpful.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03327890 "polls")

The paper proposes that: 

> in general, numeric probabilities are precise but lack direction, whereas verbal probabilities have direction but lack precision

With direction here meaning positive or negative connotations. For example, hearing that an event is "likely" gives me more context on whether a forecaster thinks it'll happen compared to an "80%" prediction. 

Having established the difference between numeric and verbal probabilities, the authors study how people combine these probabilities:

> we refer to participants using “averaging” or “counting” strategies when combining forecasts, 

> “averaging” to refer to a combination strategy by which the participant takes a weighted average of the advisors’ forecasts, placing their own forecast in between the advisors’ forecasts

> “counting” to refer to a combination strategy by which participants interpret each of the advisors’ forecasts as a positive signal and adjust their own forecasts in the direction of the signal

For example, if received multiple forecasts ranging from 60 to 80%, an "averaging" strategy would get you close to 70%, whereas a "counting" strategy would get you above 80% since so many forecasts confirmed your point of view \[32\]. If you received multiple forecasts that mostly said an event was "likely", an "averaging" strategy would conclude it was "likely", whereas a "counting" strategy would think the event was "highly likely" since so many people said it was "likely"

The researchers found that people combined numerics and verbal probabilities differently: 

> although people average multiple numeric forecasts, they “count” multiple verbal probability forecasts, resulting in forecasts that are more extreme than each advisor’s forecast

In other words, we average out to get to 70% in the example above, but once you convert those numerical predictions to verbal ones, we "count" the number of predictions and get to "highly likely" instead of averaging.  

Lastly, the researchers show that all this is important since it shapes your behaviour: 

> Study 4 demonstrates that these different strategies influence subsequent consumer decisions

A takeaway from the book [Superforecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecasting "Super") was to be more precise when predicting events, since verbal predictions are ambiguous. Given the research above, it seems that numerical predictions are also more easily combined correctly \[33\]. I've tried to provide numerical predictions when I can in my writing in order to increase accountability, and would encourage you to do the same. That said, I'm only 25% confident people will change their ways.

32. Of course this depends on the distribution of those predictions and how you weight them, but I'm simplifying for ease of explanation.
33. There is criticism that Superforecasting is invalid, and I'll leave you to read that yourself. Also, "counting" could be an appropriate strategy sometimes.
