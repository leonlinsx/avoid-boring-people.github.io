**Rebalance timing**

Investors with a diversified portfolio usually rebalance their portfolios regularly, meaning they adjust their investment sizes to get back to their ideal portfolio proportions. For example, if your ideal portfolio is 60% equity and 40% bonds, once a year you might check that ratio and buy and sell equities or bonds to get back to 60% equity and 40% bonds.

Does the timing of when you do this rebalancing matter? [This research by Corey Hoffstein](https://blog.thinknewfound.com/2019/11/the-dumb-timing-luck-of-smart-beta/ "Corey") claims it does. They define and measure "timing luck" as the difference in performance from choosing a rebalance date e.g. choosing June instead of December.

> Higher turnover strategies have higher timing luck.
> Strategies that rebalance more frequently have lower timing luck.
> Strategies with a less constrained universe will have higher timing luck.

The paper discusses how they construct different portfolios. For sake of brevity I'll leave out. 

You can see the difference in returns for a portfolio that is rebalanced at different times in the year, with the arrow below representing the delta between the best performing and the worst performing variation, *of the same portfolio*.

They also present a summary table showing that delta. To understand the below, it's saying that $1 in the "Enhanced Value" portfolio could have returned you from $4.45 to $5.45, and that entire $1 difference is due to luck in when you rebalance. 

> For reasonably concentrated portfolios (100 stocks) with semi-annual rebalance frequencies (common in many index definitions), annual timing luck ranged from 1-to-4%, which translated to a 95% confidence interval in annual performance dispersion of about +/-1.5% to +/-12.5%.

> The sheer magnitude of timing luck calls into question our ability to draw meaningful relative performance conclusions between two strategies.

One proposed solution for the individual investor is to split your portfolio, though this seems like a lot of work: 

> we believe that our momentum portfolio should be rebalanced every quarter \[...\] we proposed splitting our capital across the three portfolios that spanned different three-month rebalance periods (e.g. JAN-APR-JUL-OCT, FEB-MAY-AUG-NOV, MAR-JUN-SEP-DEC). This solution is referred to either as “tranching” or “overlapping portfolios.”

**How likely is likely**

If I tell you:

  - An expert says it's likely I quit my job to be Jameela Jamil's exclusive bartender \[30\]
  - A second expert also says it's likely
  
Would you think that it's "likely" or "highly likely" that this occurs?

What if:

  - The first expert says there's an 80% chance of the above happening
  - The second expert says there's an 70% chance
  
What would you think is the probability of this happening now? And would you say that is "likely?" "Highly likely?" 

[This paper by Celia Gaertig and Robert Mislavsky](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3454796 "paper") discusses how people combine probability predictions from multiple sources, by conducting experiments similar to the above. If you've been reading this newsletter for a while, it should not be a surprise that we're inconsistent in our judgement and combination of probabilities \[31\]. 

We all treat verbal and numerical probabilities differently; organisations and people have differing ideas of how likely "likely" is:

> an event described as “likely” in an IPCC \[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\] report must have a 66% to 100% likelihood of occurring. On the other hand, an event described as “likely” in a DNI \[US Director of National Intelligence\] report must have a 55% to 80% likelihood. 

And of course, if you polled your friends on their definition of "likely", [you'd get such a wide range of answers it'd be unhelpful.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03327890 "polls")

The paper proposes that: 

> in general, numeric probabilities are precise but lack direction, whereas verbal probabilities have direction but lack precision

With direction here meaning positive or negative connotations. For example, hearing that an event is "likely" gives me more context and confidence compared to an "80%" prediction. 

Having established the difference between numeric and verbal probabilities, the authors study how people combine these probabilities:

> we refer to participants using “averaging” or “counting” strategies when combining forecasts, 

> “averaging” to refer to a combination strategy by which the participant takes a weighted average of the advisors’ forecasts, placing their own forecast in between the advisors’ forecasts

> “counting” to refer to a combination strategy by which participants interpret each of the advisors’ forecasts as a positive signal and adjust their own forecasts in the direction of the signal

For example, if received multiple forecasts ranging from 60 to 80%, an "averaging" strategy would get you close to 70%, whereas a "counting" strategy would get you above 80% since so many forecasts confirmed your point of view \[32\]. If you received multiple forecasts that mostly said an event was "likely", an "averaging" strategy would conclude it was "likely", whereas a "counting" strategy would think the event was "highly likely" since so many people said it was "likely"

The researchers found that people combined numerics and verbal probabilities differently: 

> although people average multiple numeric forecasts, they “count” multiple verbal probability forecasts, resulting in forecasts that are more extreme than each advisor’s forecast

In other words, we average out to get to 70% in the example above, but once you convert those numerical predictions to verbal ones, we "count" the number of predictions and get to "highly likely" instead of averaging. The researchers also show that this influences behaviour, and consumers can be influenced to purchase an item depending on how the predictions are presented. 

Whether you should "count" or "average" though depends on whether your experts have similar or different information. If they are working off the same information, "averaging" works better at cancelling out idiosyncratic erros. If they are not, then "counting" could be an approximation of a Bayesian strategy that improves your personal forecast.
