**Takeaways**

- The newsletter flywheel and introducing a paid tier for weekly updates

- 5 favourite articles I wrote, 10 favourite links I sent, and 6 new additions to my reading list
- 15 shoutouts to friends and acquaintances building cool stuff

**Experimenting with paid weekly subscriber updates**

Starting Jan 25 I'll be experimenting with paid weekly updates, in addition to the free monthly update. I'll elaborate below in the annual review section, and the main points are:

- Pricing is $6/mth or $60/year. Early subscribers get a discount and lifetime pricing of $5/mth or $50/year
- This gets you early, direct access to weekly content that will be shorter and more varied
- The monthly content will remain free for as long as I keep writing

If you like living life loosely and sending strangers stipends without even knowing further details, here's the paid subscription button:

And now, here's how we avoided boring people in 2019:

**Favourite articles I wrote**

Of course, all my writing ~~is the best~~ can keep getting better. Nevertheless, these were my favourite pieces the past year \[10\]:

1. [Would you buy the Libra Neopet Kin token?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/would-you-buy-the-libra-neopet-kin?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Libra") In which I profess to not understanding Facebook's Libra at all.

2. [Can you see things in a different way?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/can-you-see-things-in-a-different?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Visualise") In which I realise everyone visualises things differently

3. [Why were freelance monks banned by the church?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/why-were-freelance-monks-banned-by?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "employment") In which I comment on why Nassim Taleb thinks employment is legal slavery

4. [Tell me why.](https://www.leonlinsx.com/tell-me-why/ "Tell") In which I question why we believe in anything at all

**Footnotes**

2. Trying to link together unrelated topics into one coherent narrative took a lot of time, and didn't seem to improve reader engagement, making it not worth the time
3. The keyword here being experiment, which means there's a chance this blows up in my face
4. I'm doing a terrible job of selling this aren't I. However, I believe that this is worth trying out and would only want paid readers that really want it. I'm still maintaining the personal website, as it has functionality that substack doesn't and I want to keep something entirely of my own.
5. Honour system here, I can't keep track of everyone who was given a complimentary subscription. Please don't be shy about it; if I were in your shoes I'd totally ask to get upgraded for free
10. Note that I said favourite pieces, not necessarily the best or most popular. Just as people can like Love Actually, I can like something without it being good. Pieces that missed the cutoff included [my notes from an investment conference](https://www.leonlinsx.com/punch-card-2019/ "Punch Card"), [additional marketplace business rake factors](https://www.leonlinsx.com/additional-marketplace-rake-factors/ "Rake"), [illusions in time](https://www.leonlinsx.com/temporal-illusions/ "temporal"), and [how likely were you to accept grandma's video game friend request?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/how-likely-would-you-accept-grandmas?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Video games")
11. Links that missed the cutoff included [how Mr Rogers anticipated the way children might misinterpret what was being said](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/mr-rogers-neighborhood-talking-to-kids/562352/ "Rogers"), [the O-ring theory of development describing when economies are organized such that one weak link can destroy the entire value of production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg "O ring"), [a thousand true fans are all you need](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/ "thousand"), [how peak depressive symptoms in girls occur earlier than in boys](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-018-0976-5 "girls depression"), and how [students learn more in active learning classes but dislike it and think they learn less.](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/39/19251 "learning")
40. As always, nothing I write is financial advice, please consult a professional financial advisor etc. Don't sue me; I have no money.
