**Best writing**
Of course, all my writing ~~is the best~~ can keep getting better. Nevertheless, these were my favourite pieces the past year:

1. 
3. [Would you buy the Libra Neopet Kin token?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/would-you-buy-the-libra-neopet-kin?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Libra") In which I profess to not understanding Facebook's Libra at all.

4. [How well can you visualise something?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/can-you-see-things-in-a-different?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Visualise")

6. [Why Nassim Taleb thinks employment can be thought of as a legal way to own another person](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/why-were-freelance-monks-banned-by?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "employment")
