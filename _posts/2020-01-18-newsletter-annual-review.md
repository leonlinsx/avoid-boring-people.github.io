**Takeaways**

- 5 favourite articles I wrote, 10 favourite links I sent, and 6 new additions to my reading list
- 15 shoutouts to friends and acquaintances building cool stuff
- Reflecting on the newsletter flywheel and introducing a paid weekly update tier

**Experimenting with paid weekly subscriber updates**

**Starting Jan 25 I'll be experimenting with paid weekly updates, in addition to the free monthly update.** I'll elaborate in the annual review section at the bottom of this email, and the main points are:

- Pricing is $6/mth or $60/year. Early subscribers will get pricing of $5/mth or $50/year (~20% discount)
- This gets you early, direct access to weekly content that will be shorter and more varied
- Monthly content will remain free for as long as I keep writing

If you like living life loosely and don't need to know more before sending strangers stipends, here's the paid subscription button:

And now, here's how we avoided boring people in 2019:

**Favourite articles I wrote**

Of course, all my writing ~~is the best~~ can keep getting better. Nevertheless, these were my favourite pieces the past year \[1\]:

1. [Would you buy the Libra Neopet Kin token?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/would-you-buy-the-libra-neopet-kin?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Libra") In which I profess to not understanding Facebook's Libra at all

2. [Can you see things in a different way?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/can-you-see-things-in-a-different?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Visualise") In which I realise everyone visualises things differently

3. [Why were freelance monks banned by the church?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/why-were-freelance-monks-banned-by?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "employment") In which I comment on why Nassim Taleb thinks employment is legal slavery

> Slave ownership by companies has traditionally taken very curious forms. The best slave is someone you overpay and who knows it, terrified of losing his status

4. [Tell me why.](https://www.leonlinsx.com/tell-me-why/ "Tell") In which I question why we believe in anything at all

Now that I've advertised others, back to shameless self-promotion: 

**Annual reflection**

I finished my annual reflection for 2019 recently, a distinct improvement compared to previous annual reflections completed in March \[6\]. Reflecting is necessary for learning; having a thoughtful template increases the effectiveness and decreases the difficulty in starting the process. This year I updated [my template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iGZJxnCs91LsHSnOK-C5ACq5SS50PEWRqCMnt2fXVY0/edit?usp=sharing "new template") by drawing on [Steve Schlafman
 and Howard Gray's version,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ais6wP0HxoFfvHR9JVkf2sw2ft_EUBtb42JYOr6ObGo/edit "template") plus other references \[7\]. This is the template that I find helpful for myself but may not be the template most helpful for you. Feel free to adjust as needed. You can take a look at [my completed reflection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iSrugAAQ9baLTXvh7Ck6YO7MUCB8CbQQqyEX8BMiUv0/edit?usp=sharing "reflection") if helpful.
 
**Why you should unsubscribe and not pay me money**

[Newsletters are seeing a resurgence](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/10/substack-revue-email-newsletter-startups-tinyletter/599557/ "Atlantic"); everyone and [their mom](https://evilwitches.substack.com/ "mom newsletter") \[8\] seems to have one now. [Byrne Hobart thinks of them as a precommitment to quality and focused content](https://medium.com/@byrnehobart/ghosting-substack-and-privatized-attention-6a05ec51dc61 "substack"); I think of them as a pendulum swing away from public, generalised noise to private, specialised content. That implies it'll swing back though. Just as blogging exploded and then slowly declined, I think newsletters as a whole will go through the same trend with 60% certainty, though we're still early in the up cycle. 

Why do I think this? The simple fact is writing is hard. I have literally stared at my screen for ten minutes thinking of what to write, ending up with this sentence \[9\]. 

People think I write like this:

When instead I'm often like this:

Most people writing now will give up after a while, once the difficulty outwears the novelty. The key to survival then is to [just keep swimming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBtc254NIMc "swimming") and ~~spamming~~ creating content.

I do so by keeping in mind [why I write](https://www.leonlinsx.com/why-i-write/ "why"). I write for myself first and foremost, since "I don’t know what I think until I read what I say” \[10\]. The readership and responses are fantastic to have, and I'll keep writing as long as I remember the primary, selfish goal. It's not you, it's me.

The annual reflection was a convenient excuse for me to think about the future for this newsletter. Like every startup out there, I think of this as a flywheel:

More engaged readers -> More ideas and feedback -> More quality content

I have 3 requests:

Readership has grown compared to when I was directly emailing family and friends years ago. Despite that, my open rates of ~60% are way above [industry average of 20% and best in class of 40%.](https://fs.blog/2019/12/2019-annual-letter/ "FS open") I need your help to keep that going, and prefer quality to quantity. To that end, **please unsubscribe if you're no longer interested** \[11\].

More engaged readers led to more ideas and feedback, a great benefit of writing publicly. You can compare [an early version of this newsletter](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/bet-against-self-control-and-sonic?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Jan") against [the current](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/ "ABP") to see how much has changed. The takeaway section upfront, separate sections, and opening banner all involved user feedback; see footnote for details \[12\]. **Please continue to send in ideas and feedback, and correct me if I'm wrong.**

Which brings me to more quality content, and my experiment with weekly updates for paid subscribers \[13\]. I want to see if there's a small subset of subscribers that would be interested in getting content more often on a weekly, paid basis. Details are:

- Pricing is $6/mth or $60/year. **Early subscribers will get pricing of $5/mth or $50/year**, a ~20% discount as recommended by substack. I'm intending to keep that as a lifetime pricing for early subs, but can't guarantee that substack's tech will let me do that in the future \[14\]. 

- **Paid subscribers get early, direct access to weekly content** \[15\]. This will be more varied than the monthly update, such as my prior posts about [controversies in the art world](https://www.leonlinsx.com/tims-vermeer/ "vermeer") or [how to take feedback better](https://www.leonlinsx.com/thanks-for-the-feedback/ "feedback"). They will also be shorter, less polished, and most importantly still available on my website after a delay. You're really paying for early access to my initial thoughts on whatever I've found interesting recently \[16\].

- **Monthly content will remain free** for as long as I keep writing, and remain structured around tech, finance, and personal growth. I anticipate taking more time to draft these and that they will be better quality than the weekly posts.

**Please subscribe here if I haven't already convinced you out of doing so**

If you were an early reader, I may have given you a complimentary subscription that didn't do anything. I'll be downgrading all of these since I don't want to opt you in to weekly emails without your consent. If you'd like to retain your status *for free*, send me a message. I'll do so, no questions asked, as part of my earlier promise to grandfather in early readers \[58\].

Thank you for all the support, and let's continue to avoid boring people in 2020.

**Footnotes**

1. Note that I said favourite pieces, not necessarily the best or most popular. Just as people can like Love Actually, I can like something without it being good. Pieces that missed the cutoff included [my notes from an investment conference](https://www.leonlinsx.com/punch-card-2019/ "Punch Card"), [additional marketplace business rake factors](https://www.leonlinsx.com/additional-marketplace-rake-factors/ "Rake"), [illusions in time](https://www.leonlinsx.com/temporal-illusions/ "temporal"), and [how likely were you to accept grandma's video game friend request?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/how-likely-would-you-accept-grandmas?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Video games")
2. Links that missed the cutoff included [how Mr Rogers anticipated the way children might misinterpret what was being said](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/mr-rogers-neighborhood-talking-to-kids/562352/ "Rogers"), [the O-ring theory of development describing when one weak link can destroy the entire value of production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg "O ring"), [a thousand true fans are all you need](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/ "thousand"), [how peak depressive symptoms in girls occur earlier than in boys](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-018-0976-5 "girls depression"), and [how students learn more in active learning classes but dislike it and think they learn less.](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/39/19251 "learning")
3. I elaborated on Pettis' post [here](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/always-be-raising?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Tariff")
4. I responded to Josh in a post [here](https://www.leonlinsx.com/additional-marketplace-rake-factors/ "Rake")
5. As always, nothing I write is financial advice, please consult a professional financial advisor etc. Don't sue me; I have no money. 
6. It was still helpful though! Would encourage you to do a reflection regardless of how late it is.
7. The others inclued [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WxAY5ujUeKKQ_Y1c-Ic_rHj2t3Kaw_GOpwTX1jY4y_k/edit?usp=sharing "template"), [Kelly Thorne Gore](https://ibloom.us/blog/10-end-of-the-year-reflection-questions/ "questions"), and [Henna Inam](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hennainam/2018/12/31/ten-questions-to-ask-in-your-personal-year-end-review/#1a0297287e7d "questions")
8. No, I'm not a subscriber. Just a top google search result. 
9. Yes, that really happened. I gave up and went to bed shortly after. What follows was written on a separate day.
10. Flannery O'Connor
11. I've regularly reminded people to unsubscribe, so this should come as no surprise to older readers. If I could, I'd make the unsubscribe button all the way at the top of the email, but there's technical limitations on substack. Friends and family - I really won't feel offended if you unsubscribe.
12. At one point in time I was trying to link together unrelated topics into one coherent narrative, as seen in [this example.](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/long-tails-and-chinese-art-theft?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Early") That took a lot of time but didn't seem to improve reader engagement, leading to me experimenting with the separate sections. The takeaways up top were directly suggested by a friend who essentially said I was too long-winded. The banner from another who suggested I was forgettable. The [post on AI](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/coming-soon?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "AI") was from a conversation with a friend, and the [Taleb article](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/why-were-freelance-monks-banned-by?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Taleb") was sent in by a friend. I think the newsletter is better now than it was even a year ago, and look forward to it improving even more.
13. The keyword here being experiment, which means there's a chance this blows up in my face. I believe in more experimentation in my personal life
14. I would charge lower, but $5/mth is the minimum allowed on substack. Substack charges 10% plus ~3% for credit card fees.
15. When I started out, I thought I might charge for the monthly updates and give the weeklies for free. However, it makes more sense to ask more engaged readers to pay instead.
16. I'm doing a terrible job of selling this aren't I. However, I believe that this is worth trying out and only want paid readers that really want it. I'm still maintaining the personal website, as it has functionality that substack doesn't and I want to keep something entirely of my own.
17. Honour system here, I can't keep track of everyone who was given a complimentary subscription. Please don't be shy about it; if I were in your shoes I'd totally ask to get upgraded for free
