Go over stats and put best links

**Favourite writing**
Of course, all my writing ~~is the best~~ can keep getting better. Nevertheless, these were my favourite pieces the past year \[10\]:

1. [Would you buy the Libra Neopet Kin token?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/would-you-buy-the-libra-neopet-kin?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Libra") In which I profess to not understanding Facebook's Libra at all.

3. [Why were freelance monks banned by the church?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/why-were-freelance-monks-banned-by?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "employment") In which I comment on why Nassim Taleb thinks employment is legal slavery
