**Takeaways**

- 5 favourite articles I wrote, 10 favourite links I sent, and 6 new additions to my reading list
- 15 shoutouts to friends and acquaintances building cool stuff
- Reflecting on the newsletter flywheel and introducing a paid weekly update tier

**Experimenting with paid weekly subscriber updates**

**Starting Jan 25 I'll be experimenting with paid weekly updates, in addition to the free monthly update.** I'll elaborate in the annual review section at the bottom of this email, and the main points are:

- Pricing is $6/mth or $60/year. Early subscribers get lifetime pricing of $5/mth or $50/year (~20% discount)
- This gets you early, direct access to weekly content that will be shorter and more varied
- Monthly content will remain free for as long as I keep writing

If you like living life loosely and don't need to know more before sending strangers stipends, here's the paid subscription button:

And now, here's how we avoided boring people in 2019:

**Favourite articles I wrote**

Of course, all my writing ~~is the best~~ can keep getting better. Nevertheless, these were my favourite pieces the past year \[1\]:

1. [Would you buy the Libra Neopet Kin token?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/would-you-buy-the-libra-neopet-kin?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Libra") In which I profess to not understanding Facebook's Libra at all

2. [Can you see things in a different way?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/can-you-see-things-in-a-different?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Visualise") In which I realise everyone visualises things differently

3. [Why were freelance monks banned by the church?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/why-were-freelance-monks-banned-by?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "employment") In which I comment on why Nassim Taleb thinks employment is legal slavery

> Slave ownership by companies has traditionally taken very curious forms. The best slave is someone you overpay and who knows it, terrified of losing his status

4. [Tell me why.](https://www.leonlinsx.com/tell-me-why/ "Tell") In which I question why we believe in anything at all

5. [Public secrets.](https://www.leonlinsx.com/public-secrets/ "Public") In which I list secrets industry insiders all know but wouldn't want to admit publicly

> Rigged: News sites, universities, music competitions

5. [Which of these lines below are from a famous poem, and which are from AI?](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/19/gpt-2-as-step-toward-general-intelligence/ "moloch")

  > Moloch whose brief mind is the barrel of gleaming stars! Moloch whose soul is choices of fragrance! Moloch whose framing is glitz and half-cheerios!

  > Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!

  > Moloch for I donâ€™t believe in god! Moloch who, fought Sins and made Sin out of Sin!

Now that I've advertised others, back to shameless self-promotion: 

**Annual reflection**

I finished my annual reflection for 2019 recently, a distinct improvement compared to previous annual reflections completed in March \[50\]. Reflecting is necessary for learning; having a thoughtful template increases the effectiveness and decreases the difficulty in starting the process. This year I updated [my template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iGZJxnCs91LsHSnOK-C5ACq5SS50PEWRqCMnt2fXVY0/edit?usp=sharing "new template") by drawing on [Steve Schlafman
 and Howard Gray's version,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ais6wP0HxoFfvHR9JVkf2sw2ft_EUBtb42JYOr6ObGo/edit "template") plus other references \[51\]. This is the template that I find helpful for myself but may not be the template most helpful for you. Feel free to adjust as needed. You can take a look at [my completed reflection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iSrugAAQ9baLTXvh7Ck6YO7MUCB8CbQQqyEX8BMiUv0/edit?usp=sharing "reflection") if helpful.
 
**Why you should unsubscribe and not pay me money**

Newsletters are seeing a resurgence; everyone and [their mom](https://evilwitches.substack.com/ "mom newsletter") seems to have one now. [Byrne Hobart thinks of them as a precommitment to quality and focused content](https://medium.com/@byrnehobart/ghosting-substack-and-privatized-attention-6a05ec51dc61 "substack"); I think of them as a pendulum swing away from public, generalised noise to private, specialised content. Just as blogging exploded and then slowly declined, I think newsletters as a whole will go through the same trend with 60% certainty, though we're still early in the up cycle. 

Writing is hard. I have literally stared at my screen for ten minutes thinking of what to write, and so I ended up writing this sentence. 
 
just like 11/10 biz claim to be the next https://blog.ycombinator.com/read-this-before-you-build-uber-for-x/ 

**Footnotes**


1. Note that I said favourite pieces, not necessarily the best or most popular. Just as people can like Love Actually, I can like something without it being good. Pieces that missed the cutoff included [my notes from an investment conference](https://www.leonlinsx.com/punch-card-2019/ "Punch Card"), [additional marketplace business rake factors](https://www.leonlinsx.com/additional-marketplace-rake-factors/ "Rake"), [illusions in time](https://www.leonlinsx.com/temporal-illusions/ "temporal"), and [how likely were you to accept grandma's video game friend request?](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/how-likely-would-you-accept-grandmas?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Video games")
2. Links that missed the cutoff included [how Mr Rogers anticipated the way children might misinterpret what was being said](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/mr-rogers-neighborhood-talking-to-kids/562352/ "Rogers"), [the O-ring theory of development describing when one weak link can destroy the entire value of production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg "O ring"), [a thousand true fans are all you need](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/ "thousand"), [how peak depressive symptoms in girls occur earlier than in boys](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-018-0976-5 "girls depression"), and [how students learn more in active learning classes but dislike it and think they learn less.](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/39/19251 "learning")
3. I elaborated on Pettis' post [here](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/always-be-raising?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Tariff")
4. I responded to Josh in a post [here](https://www.leonlinsx.com/additional-marketplace-rake-factors/ "Rake")
40. As always, nothing I write is financial advice, please consult a professional financial advisor etc. Don't sue me; I have no money. 
50. It was still helpful though! 
51. The others inclued [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WxAY5ujUeKKQ_Y1c-Ic_rHj2t3Kaw_GOpwTX1jY4y_k/edit?usp=sharing "template"), [Kelly Thorne Gore](https://ibloom.us/blog/10-end-of-the-year-reflection-questions/ "questions"), and [Henna Inam](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hennainam/2018/12/31/ten-questions-to-ask-in-your-personal-year-end-review/#1a0297287e7d "questions")
2. Trying to link together unrelated topics into one coherent narrative took a lot of time, and didn't seem to improve reader engagement, making it not worth the time
3. The keyword here being experiment, which means there's a chance this blows up in my face
4. I'm doing a terrible job of selling this aren't I. However, I believe that this is worth trying out and would only want paid readers that really want it. I'm still maintaining the personal website, as it has functionality that substack doesn't and I want to keep something entirely of my own.
5. Honour system here, I can't keep track of everyone who was given a complimentary subscription. Please don't be shy about it; if I were in your shoes I'd totally ask to get upgraded for free
