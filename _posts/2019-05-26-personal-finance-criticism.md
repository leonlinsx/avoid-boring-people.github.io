Everyone wants to get rich quick. I do too. Fortunately the typical 'get rich quick' scheme is easy to spot, and most of us do not fall for them \[1\]. 

Everyone wants to get rich easily. I do too. Unfortunately the typical 'get rich easily' tips are hard to spot, and most of us do fall for them. We downplay simple advice to overindex on complicated products that make us feel good but perform below average.

Both [Of Dollars and Data](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/stop-the-financial-pornography/ "financial pornography") and [Morgan Housel](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/realistic-personal-finance-hacks/ "finance hacks") commented about the state of personal financial advice recently, coming from different angles. Nick at [Of Dollars and Data](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/about/ "About Nick") took issue with people giving financial advice that was inapplicable to people outside of exceptional circumstances, while Morgan offered simple advice that was applicable to most people.

From Nick:

> Financial pornography is the normalization of exceptional financial circumstances in order to gain attention.

> This is the nature of financial pornography.  It seduces you with the idea of something more, but, ultimately, provides nothing of substance.

Nick goes on to cite examples that might be similar to articles you've seen before: a woman interning in Manhattan while making $25/hr, who conveniently happens to have her parents pick up major expenses. Or the real estate millionaire who made it through his 10 rules, while also using 100% financing. Or others who post about how 'holding X for 10 years would have made you rich' while ignoring the behavioural component of doing so.

I agree with Nick on this. There is too much financial clickbait online providing unhelpful advice. This is understandable though when you consider most publishers are incentivised to drive views for ad revenue, and pushing out surprising content is a convenient way to do so.  

Everyone wants to get rich. I do too. But there's good and bad advice, some misleading and some not. Be careful of what you read and believe.

1. We could always do with more education for people that do fall for these schemes, but I'm assuming that if you somehow found this blog you're less likely to fall in [the category that mails money to Nigerian princes.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/nigerian-prince-scams-still-rake-in-over-700000-dollars-a-year.html "nigerian prince")
