### Return on dividends

In [footnote 8 of last week's free post](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/a-story-is-a-lie-and-a-story-is-true "footnote") I made a throwaway remark on dividends mattering less than capital return because I didn't want to spend more time digging into the subject.

Today, let's actually dig into dividends. 

We'll do an overview of dividends, then discuss drawbacks, and end with factors that complicate the story.

As always, none of this is investment advice \[1\].

#### What to do with all that cash

Suppose you're a publicly listed company that makes a profit \[2\]. You've paid your suppliers, you've paid your employees, and you've paid yourself. You still have more cash left over though, so what can you do with that?

One, you could do nothing. Just let it sit in a bank somewhere \[3\]. 

Two, you could reinvest in the business. That machine you wanted for your manufacturing line? That software product for your HR team? [That Gulfstream G650 to get high?](https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-is-not-the-way-everybody-behaves-how-adam-neumanns-over-the-top-style-built-wework-11568823827 "WSJ") Perhaps now might be the time to buy them.

Three, you could buy other businesses. Perhaps there's a smaller competitor that you can acquire on the cheap and get all those "synergies" that your banking buddies tell you about in order to grow market share \[4\].

Four, you could buy back some of your shares. This increases the ownership you have of your company, which implies that you get more upside if the company does well. Buybacks are out of scope for this article, you can read an inital (biased) take on them by Cliff Asness [here.](https://images.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Journal-Articles/Buyback-Derangement-Syndrome.pdf "Cliff")

Five, you could pay a dividend to investors. For each share that investors have, you hand them some cash every quarter. 

I've simplified, as always, and the actions above are the main things companies do with their money. A graph from CS shows us how the mix of those actions has changed over time:

We'll focus on that last action, the dividend payment. I'll skip over discussing the theoretical irrelevance of capital structures \[5\], but you can read a refresher on Modigliani Miller [here](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.2.4.99 "MM")

#### Evaluating dividends

On first glance, a dividend sounds good to you as an investor. Getting some cash back on your stock seems nice. Let's look at how we might evaluate it.

If I told you that a company dividend was $5, would that be good or bad? It sounds like a lot of 

### Footnotes

1. I have never and will never give investment advice. Don't sue me, I have no money.
2. A surprisingly less frequent occurrence than one might think these days...
3. It's not quite as simple as this in reality, and companies have treasury departments that manage how much liquid cash they have on hand vs other money instruments that return some yield. Nobody really has billions in paper bills lying around, or even in checking accounts for that matter.
4. Synergies are usually thought of as either revenue or cost synergies. Revenue synergies coming from being able to sell more stuff and cost synergies from firing people.
5. Under certain assumptions, how a company is financed doesn't matter. If that's the case, then capital allocation policies are essentially the same.
