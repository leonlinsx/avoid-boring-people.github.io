## Update to 2019 review of Substack, the email newsletter service

Last year, I wrote [a review of Substack](https://www.leonlinsx.com/substack/ "substack") that still ranks on the front page of Google. Today I want to revisit that review with new thoughts on Substack and the newsletter industry.

We'll cover:

1. Overview of Substack features 
2. What I've liked so far
3. What I haven't liked
4. Crowdsourced feature wishlist
5. Thoughts on the newsletter industry

## 1. Substack is still a simple way to start, and that counts for a lot

[Email newsletters have been rising in popularity since 2019](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/theres-more-to-communities-than-facebook "Substack"), and part of the reasons are Substack's funding announcement, a pendulum shift back to subscription revenue, and high profile writers starting a newsletter \[1\].

Substack was and still is one of the easiest ways to set up a professional newsletter. By that I mean something that's **moved on from directly emailing people,** which is how many people start out \[2\].

Some good reasons to move to a professional service like Substack include:

- Posting publicly allows discovery, sharing, and faster growth of your readership
- Access to tools to monitor readership base, such as open rates, click rates, growth over time
- More professional, better looking, and fancy formatted emails

Substack's changed the sign up flow since I joined, so here's a brief walkthrough of the flow and writing process:

You need an email account to create a substack account, and you need to create a substack account in order to explore the features i.e. there's no guest preview mode.

After you've set up a profile pic, name, and bio, the next step is to choose your publication details. After that, you can import a mailing list csv, if you already have a readership base from elsewhere.

You're now done with the basic account setup and can start posting. Substack automatically creates a first welcome post for you, so that the landing page for your newsletter doesn't look completely empty.

Posting is simple as well. You go to your dashboard, click on create a new post, and that directs you to the Substack editor. The editor is largely a ["What you see is what you get"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG "wiki") editor, with standard formatting options. I'll comment more in section 3.

Once you're done writing, you can publish it out to your email list. There's some options you can choose, such as scheduling the post, changing the preview, or restricting it to paid subscribers.

## 4. 

What’s working great:
The combo of email + automatic blog
Ease of setting up for a new writer
Ability to schedule posts
Ability to import/export subscriber list
Ability to create discounted offers, and comps
The subscribe flow

Roughly prioritized wishlist:
Custom domains
Pricing
Improved pricing for large accounts. Perhaps switch over from variable fee to fixed fee once at a certain size of paid subs. Current take rate feels too high vs alternatives
Easier facilitation of group/corporate subscription
Help grow our audience
Better SEO in general. Unclear why one of us is on the 5th page of Google results when he wrote the first article on the topic and got linked to by the NYT
A referrals program
More help for new writers that are still building audience vs established writers
More marketing of unknown writers
Increased features for editor
Shareable links to subsections rather than entire article -- sub-heading URLs so you can share different segments of a newsletter with a different image, headline, body preview on Twitter etc
Font customizability - font face, size, color, etc.
Changing width of text on page
Captions for images!
Proper footnoting with either links or popup dialogue boxes
Ability to customize the URL and ideally to know it ahead of time
Embeds for more media (especially TikToks) the way Tweets currently work
Ability to leave multiple whitespace empty lines for emphasis 
Better audience management 
Biggest fans feature to show who drove the most opens over a month/all time so you can thank and reward them --  I want to see who my top readers are, how many open every email, and be able to email them
Ability to target inactive subscribers specifically for reminder emails or to unsubscribe them
Churn and cohort analysis
Reliability
Site uptime
Work with Gmail so articles don’t end up in promo, updates, or spam folder
Have been seeing emails drop and not be sent
Health insurance
API access

## Footnotes

1. For example, Casey Newton of the Verge, Polina Marinova of Term Sheet, or Josh Constine of Techcrunch all started newsletters on substack
2. Myself included, which is a story for another time. I started off with 8 people in my mailing list, not even bccing people, and less structure
