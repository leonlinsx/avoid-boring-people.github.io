## Update to 2019 review of Substack, the email newsletter service

Last year, I wrote [a review of Substack](https://www.leonlinsx.com/substack/ "substack") that still ranks on the front page of Google. Today I want to revisit that review with new thoughts on Substack and the newsletter industry.

We'll go over:

1. Overview of Substack features 
2. What I've liked so far
3. What I haven't liked
4. Crowdsourced feature wishlist
5. Thoughts on the newsletter industry

## 1. Substack is a simple way to set up an email newsletter service



## 2. 

compare to ghost

## 3. 

## 4. 

What’s working great:
The combo of email + automatic blog
Ease of setting up for a new writer
Ability to schedule posts
Ability to import/export subscriber list
Ability to create discounted offers, and comps
The subscribe flow

Roughly prioritized wishlist:
Custom domains
Pricing
Improved pricing for large accounts. Perhaps switch over from variable fee to fixed fee once at a certain size of paid subs. Current take rate feels too high vs alternatives
Easier facilitation of group/corporate subscription
Help grow our audience
Better SEO in general. Unclear why one of us is on the 5th page of Google results when he wrote the first article on the topic and got linked to by the NYT
A referrals program
More help for new writers that are still building audience vs established writers
More marketing of unknown writers
Increased features for editor
Shareable links to subsections rather than entire article -- sub-heading URLs so you can share different segments of a newsletter with a different image, headline, body preview on Twitter etc
Font customizability - font face, size, color, etc.
Changing width of text on page
Captions for images!
Proper footnoting with either links or popup dialogue boxes
Ability to customize the URL and ideally to know it ahead of time
Embeds for more media (especially TikToks) the way Tweets currently work
Ability to leave multiple whitespace empty lines for emphasis 
Better audience management 
Biggest fans feature to show who drove the most opens over a month/all time so you can thank and reward them --  I want to see who my top readers are, how many open every email, and be able to email them
Ability to target inactive subscribers specifically for reminder emails or to unsubscribe them
Churn and cohort analysis
Reliability
Site uptime
Work with Gmail so articles don’t end up in promo, updates, or spam folder
Have been seeing emails drop and not be sent
Health insurance
API access
