Shane Parrish at Farnam Street [did another interview with Michael Mauboussin](https://fs.blog/2013/08/michael-mauboussin-interview-no-4/ "FS Mauboussin") recently. There's some repeat ideas that Mauboussin has talked about before, but as always there's much to learn from the conversation. My highlights below:

> Q: If you could hop on the elevator with your younger self going into your first day on the job, what would you say?

> A: \[...\] I would encourage my younger self to read widely, to constantly learn, and to develop points of view independent of what others say and based on facts. Specifically, I would recommend developing the habit of reading. Constantly ask good questions and seek to answer them. 

[Charlie Munger has been quoted before](https://25iq.com/2015/07/26/a-dozen-things-charlie-munger-has-said-about-reading/ "Munger") on having a similar view of reading widely. What's interesting here is Mauboussin's incremental advice to have a question that you're curious about, and then seek to answer it.
