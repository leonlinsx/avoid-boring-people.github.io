**Takeaways**

1. People literally imagine things differently 
2. IPO
3. 

**How well can you visualise something?**

Apparently everyone visualises things differently? Do this 10 second test:

**IPO**

**Footnotes**
1. I haven't yet ruled out that this is a highly elaborate prank of hers...

**Shoutouts**
1. Friend of a friend started [a tennis club in NYC](https://www.breakthelove.com/ "break the love") \[10\]
2. Some of you may know I like making drinks on the side. I asked a friend to take some photos recently and love how they turned out. Check out [his photography site if you happen to need an NYC based photographer!](http://www.kevinhwong.com/ "Kevin")

[“We’re told that science self-corrects, but what the candidate-gene literature demonstrates is that it often self-corrects very slowly, and very wastefully, even when the writing has been on the wall for a very long time,”](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/waste-1000-studies/589684/ "waste") I've written about the replicability crisis before [here](https://www.leonlinsx.com/replicability-crisis/ "link")

5. ["The coaching interventions make some students realize that more effort is needed to attain good grades but, rather than working harder, they settle by adjusting grade expectations downwards."](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26059 "NBER") I wonder if this generalises to most of work and life outside of school. Once we learn how hard getting good at something is, we lower our internal expectations? Makes me think about [this article on ambition](https://www.perell.com/blog/the-paradox-of-ambition "Perell"), which I want to explore in a future newsletter.
