**Takeaways**

1. People literally imagine things differently 
2. IPO
3. 

**How well can you visualise something?**

I just learnt that people visualise differently. Take this 10 second test:

![aphantasia]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Aphantasia-test.png)

I'm at a 3 to 4, whereas my cousin swears she's at a 6 \[1\]. This goes a long way towards explaining my confusion whenever people were telling me to visualise things... I never could get the detail and clarity that everyone else seemed to be experiencing. 

For those people that score a 1, you likely have [aphantasia](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-34039054 "BBC"), a condition in which you're unable to visualise mental images. [There's skepticism over whether it's real,](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/ab1fi4/is_aphantasia_real_exaggerated_or_a/ "reddit") but the research seems convincing, particularly the [older paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26792259_Loss_of_imagery_phenomenology_with_intact_visuo-spatial_task_performance_A_case_of_'blind_imagination' "older") that found a person that initially had high visual memory and then lost it, hence being able to talk about the difference in the two states. The research estimates 2% of the population having aphantasia, a small amount are on the other extreme of the scale (hyperphantasia) and most people are in the middle. 

[The newer paper](https://www.eugencpopa.ro/wp-content/uploads/Afantazia-.pdf "newer") has a questionnaire that is more scientific than my simple test above that you might want to check out for confirmation as well. I'm inferring that a score of ~30 or lower indicates aphantasia, and a higher score close to 80 indicates hyperphantasia \[3\].

Was an interesting day when I realised the way I think is completely different from how most people think. And the strange thing is I could have gone my entire life without knowing, since it's not something you'd discover on your own. In addition to the low occurrence, no wonder it's taken so long for the scientific community to realise the existence of aphantasia. What's even stranger is that despite this literally life-changing knowledge, I don't see how anything changes for me. [It doesn't seem like you can learn to get better](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-the-minds-eye-is-blind1/ "learning"), implying we're all stuck at whatever we grew up with (or were born into?). It also doesn't seem like there have been many negative side effects. It *has* made me less confused whenever I read or hear people talking about using my imagination though.

**IPO**

**Newsletter trend**

After I published last month's newsletter, [a16z led a $15mm funding round in Substack](https://on.substack.com/p/the-future-of-substack "substack site"), the platform I'm currently using to send this \[30\]. I'm going to talk about why a16z was interested in Substack, why I started writing and why you should too. 

From [a16z's press release](https://a16z.com/2019/07/16/substack/ "a16z"):

**Footnotes**

1. I haven't yet ruled out that this is a highly elaborate prank of hers...
2. The 2 graphs on pg 9 have an obvious break around the 32 VVIQ mark, and the highest possible score is 80
30. I'd like to take credit for Substack and Cameo both raising up rounds after I wrote about them, but somehow doubt that I'm actually that influential.

**Shoutouts**

1. Friend of a friend started [a tennis service in NYC](https://www.breakthelove.com/ "break the love") \[10\]
2. Some of you may know I like making drinks on the side. I asked a friend to take some photos recently and love how they turned out. Check out [his photography site if you happen to need an NYC based photographer!](http://www.kevinhwong.com/ "Kevin")

5. ["The coaching interventions make some students realize that more effort is needed to attain good grades but, rather than working harder, they settle by adjusting grade expectations downwards."](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26059 "NBER") I wonder if this generalises to most of work and life outside of school. Once we learn how hard getting good at something is, we lower our internal expectations? Makes me think about [this article on ambition](https://www.perell.com/blog/the-paradox-of-ambition "Perell"), which I want to explore in a future newsletter.
