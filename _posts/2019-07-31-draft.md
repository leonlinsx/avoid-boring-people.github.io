1. [More](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-07-01/they-don-t-pay-traders-like-they-used-to "Levine") [people](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/facebook-is-backpedaling-from-its-ambitious-vision-for-libra/ "arstechnica") [write]
2. [“We’re told that science self-corrects, but what the candidate-gene literature demonstrates is that it often self-corrects very slowly, and very wastefully, even when the writing has been on the wall for a very long time,”](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/waste-1000-studies/589684/ "waste") I've written about the replicability crisis before [here](https://www.leonlinsx.com/replicability-crisis/ "link")
3. [Alternative measures of health such as grip strength and pushup capability might be more effective than traditional measures](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/06/push-ups-body-weight-bmi/592834/ "Health measures")

5. ["The coaching interventions make some students realize that more effort is needed to attain good grades but, rather than working harder, they settle by adjusting grade expectations downwards."](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26059 "NBER") I wonder if this generalises to most of work and life outside of school. Once we learn how hard getting good at something is, we lower our internal expectations?
