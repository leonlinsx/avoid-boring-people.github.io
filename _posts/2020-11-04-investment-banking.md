## Main

I've had to explain to a few people what investment banking's actually about recently, and I figured I might as well do a short primer here as well. Especially given the mismatch between expectations and reality, hopefully this will help clarify things.

**Investment banking is generally not about investing,** despite my parents' never seeming to have understood that. Sidenote: I've been trying to find the etymology of when "merchant banking" turned into "investment banking," but haven't had luck so far. If you happen to know, please get in touch.

A "full service" bank like JP Morgan is enormous. You can think about it as four main lines of business:

When I refer to investment banking or banking in this article, I'm specifically talking about the blue business on the right. And to make my life easier, I'll focus just on the "Banker" box, excluding discussion of the equity research and sales and trading arms for simplicity. I've mentioned equity research [here](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/you-dont-want-quality-time-you-want "er") before when discussing the impact of roboadvisors.

So now that we know our scope, what does the investment banking group do? 

I've always liked this framework that a professor of mine used \[1\], and it goes like this:

Banks are middlemen. Specifically, middlemen of financial capital \[2\].

The world has a lot of people with capital, looking to use it. For example, a pension fund might be looking to diversify, an endowment might be wanting higher returns, or a company might be looking to acquire another.

The world also has a lot of people who need capital. For example, a company might issue debt or equity in order to fund their operations.

The business of the bank is to **make a market** between the two groups.

For example, if Google is trying to raise debt, the bank will work with it to figure out how much they can raise, who will buy the debt, and what terms the debt will be issued at. 

Some but not all banks are structured into two large groups, **industry coverage** and **product coverage** \[3\]. Industry referring to providing advice to companies in that industry vertical. Product here referring to a type of financial product such as corporate finance advisory, equity capital markets, debt capital markets, leveraged finance, and mergers and acquisitions.

Industry coverage is easier to understand, so I'll just explain the various financial products.



Everyone hates middlemen until they have to try making a market for themselves

## Footnotes

1. [Prof Maillet of McIntire](https://www.commerce.virginia.edu/faculty/pam5x "prof")
2. Sometimes human capital too, but that's usually unintentional and rarer
3. I can't actually remember anymore which ones have which structure. The alternative is to have a single group of industry coverage that does both functions.
