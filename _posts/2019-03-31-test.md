A friend forwarded me [this post](https://geoff-yamane.com/blog/2019/2/28/the-investing-meta-game "investing meta") on investing, and it's one of the best I've read. Select quotes:

> DCF-investing works because most other investors also believe, or will eventually, that a DCF is a reasonable measure of fair value for a company. Investors deal in relative, not absolute truths.

I've read and liked [Mauboussin's writing](https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/document-805915460.pdf "PE multiple") on what a PE multiple means based on fundamental principles, and he also has an [EV/EBITDA piece](https://www.bluemountaincapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/What-Does-an-EV-EBITDA-Multiple-Mean.pdf "EV EBITDA multiple"). However, I'm not sure how much the buyside or sellside thinks of multiples based on what Mauboussin outlines. Sure, you can take the inverse of the P/E to get earnings yield \[1\] and compare that to your return expectations, but what's the equivalent for EV/Sales or EV/EBITDA? When you put a target multiple on your EPS to get a price target, how are you choosing the multiple? I'd argue a multiple mostly represents investor sentiment over fundamentals.
