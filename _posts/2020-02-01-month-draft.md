**Takeaways**

1.
2. 
3. Improve decision making in a company by adopting rough, not total consensus

**Question of the month**

**Direct**

Aswath Damodaran, one of the best finance profs out there \[20\], [wrote about direct listings vs IPOs awhile ago]( http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2019/10/disrupting-ipo-process-challenging.html? "Aswath"). I'll review highlights below; banking ex-colleagues feel free to disagree. If you aren't familiar with direct listings, [a16z has a primer.](https://a16z.com/2019/07/02/direct-listings/ "a16z")

> but the biggest difference \[in direct listings\] is that it cannot raise fresh capital on the offering date \[...\] That is not as much of a problem as it sounds, since the company can choose to raise cash in a pre-listing round from interested investors, or to make a secondary offering, in the months after 

The inability to raise new capital remains true for now, [after the SEC rejected a proposal to allow it](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/06/nyse-proposal-to-allow-fundraising-in-direct-listings-rejected-by-sec.html "CNBC"). As Aswath points out though, this isn't as big a deal since companies can raise before or after the listing instead.

Aswath describes the case for and against investment banking's continued involvement in IPOs \[21\]:

> **Timing:** Banks argue their experience and relationships give them insight on the best time to IPO

> Damodaran argues that no one can really time the market, as seen when momentum abruptly shifts such as late 2019

I lean more towards Damodaran's side here. In the bank's defense though, in their role as middlemen and talking to investors, they do get regular feedback on what investors are feeling. You can't say for certain until you try to go to market though.

> **Prospectus expertise:** Banks argue their experience can help guide the drafting of the filing documents

> Damodaran argues that most prospectuses look similar, particularly the risk and business sections.

I agree with Damodaran here, though as he implied some of this is due to legal reasons. Risk sections in prospectuses are more for legal protection and less for telling you what's important. 

> **Pricing of the IPO:** Banks argue 

> Pricing: It is on this front where bankers can claim to offer the most value added for three reasons. First, their knowledge of public market pricing can help them bridge the gap with the private market pricing preceding the offering, and in some cases, reduce unrealistic expectations on the part of VCs and founders. Second, they can help frame the offer pricing by finding the best metric to scale the pricing to and identifying the peer group that investors will use in public markets. Third, by reaching out to investors, bankers can not only gauge demand and fine tune the pricing but also isolate concerns that investors may have about the company. 

> bankers can expand the investor base for an issuing company

> \[Bill Gurley, a well known VC\] has been aggressively pushing young companies to consider the direct listing option more seriously. His primary argument has been focused on the underpricing on the offering date, which as he rightly points out, transfers money from private market investors to investment bankers' favored clientele.

> I think that he is framing the question too narrowly. In fact, the danger with focusing on the offer day pricing jump runs two risks

> The first is that many issuing companies not only don’t seem to mind leaving money on the table, but some actively seem to view this under pricing as good for their stock, in the long term

> The second is that Gurley's critique seems to suggest that if bankers did a better job in terms of pricing, where the stock price on the offer date is close to the offer price, that the banker-run IPO model would be okay. I think that a far stronger and persuasive argument would be to show that the problem with the banking IPO model is that changes in the world have diluted and perhaps even eliminated that value of the services that bankers offer in IPOs

> There are, I believe, three reasons why the status quo has held on and that direct listings have no become more common.

> Inertia: The strongest force in explaining much of what we see companies do in terms of investment, dividend and financing is inertia,

> Fear: Unfounded or not, there is the fear that shunning bankers may lead to consequences, ranging from negative recommendations from equity research analysts to bankers actively talking investors out of buying the stock,

> The Blame Game: One of the reasons that companies are so quick to use bankers and consultants to answer questions or take actions that they should be ready to do on their own is that it allows managers and decisions makers to pass the buck, if something goes wrong. 

**What is rough consensus and how it can improve decision making efficiency**

Decision making becomes more difficult as your organisation grows. You want to involve everyone and make them feel included, but that could spiral into multiple meetings where people give input but nothing gets done. [This summary of IETF decision making principles by Devon Zuegel](https://devonzuegel.com/post/no-kings-how-do-you-make-good-decisions-efficiently-in-a-flat-organization "Devon") \[30\] has advice I haven't seen before:

> We reject: kings, presidents and voting.

> We believe in: rough consensus and running code.

The part about rejecting individual decision makers and voting is straightforward. Running code can be thought of as getting things done; preferring action over theory. More interestingly, what does rough consensus mean?

> If \[...\] the working group has made an informed decision that the objection has been answered or is not enough of a technical problem to prevent moving forward, \[...\] there is rough consensus to go forward, the objection notwithstanding

The key insight here is that objections that are "not enough of a problem" can be overruled. This implies to go ahead with decisions that some people in the group dislike, as long as the issue isn't critical to success or failure. **You don't need everyone to agree the decision is optimal.**

> Rough consensus relies on the distinction between two types of objections:

> 1) "Not the best choice" feedback: "I don’t believe Solution A is the best choice, because XYZ. I believe Solution B would be better, but I accept that Solution A can work too."

> 2) Fundamental flaws: "I believe Solution A is unacceptable because XYZ."

During a discussion, clarify which type of objection you're getting, since people communicate with various degrees of subtlety \[31\]. My "worth taking a look at" is usually a "pretty sure this is key so I hope we have a plan". Once clarified, spend the majority of your time discussing fundamental flaws rather than "not the best choice" feedback.

How you define a fundamental flaw depends on your team, and should be decided beforehand. This is team dependent and difficult as well. Devon cites substantial technical debt, inability to scale, or too much work as some suitable reasons. You probably can't have too many reasons, as that would lead to nothing getting done. Once you've settled on your reasons, there should be a high bar to accepting new ones during the discussion itself.

People are incentivised to participate during meetings; I'd also assume that most people talk during meetings for the sake of talking \[32\]. This implies that most objections should fall under the "not the best choice" category, and you should feel alright moving forward in the majority of cases.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Two types of objections.jpg)

> A chair who asks, "Is everyone OK with choice A?" is going to get objections. But a chair who asks, "Can anyone not live with choice A?" is more likely to only hear from folks who think that choice A is impossible to engineer given some constraints

I like the reframing of the question, and intend to use it more. 

Some things that seem like consensus actually are not:

> An engineering solution that has no objections, but also has no base of support and is met with complete apathy, is not a solution that has any useful sort of consensus

> conceding when there is a real outstanding technical objection is not coming to consensus

> Even worse is the "horse-trading" sort of compromise: "\[...\] Neither of us agree. If you stop objecting to my proposal, I'll stop objecting to your proposal and we'll put them both in."

All these are related to people giving up on caring about the issue. This is problematic, and unfortunately I'm unsure of the best way to revive the interest of the group. Perhaps taking a break and coming back another week?

> One hundred people for and five people against might not be rough consensus

> Five people for and one hundred people against might still be rough consensus

[The original document](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7282 "IETF") gives more detailed examples \[33\], with the main takeaway coming back to whether the objection is a fundamental flaw or not. The number of people for or against does not matter. 

> We may use the "hell yeah" principle for hiring and some other decisions, but we use the quick iteration principle when we ship things. We don’t aim for perfection the first time — we build fast, we ship, we learn, we iterate, and we ship again

I agree. As can be inferred from my writing, I'm biased towards experimenting. You don't know what you don't know, and you can't find out until you try. There's too many slide decks and too much theorising compared to people actually executing, since the former is easier to do and still feels productive, whereas the latter is harder and uncomfortable. Unless the flaw is going to ruin your business - and few do - err on the side of getting things done \[34\].

I like the idea of rough consensus because I ~~care about very little~~ prefer efficient meetings. Since most organisations incentivise people to speak up, you usually end up with more opinions and objections than needed. While adopting a rough consensus approach seems against the principle of inclusivity, it likely increases effecctiveness in decision making.

33. "So, in a large working group with over 100 active participants and broad agreement to go forward with a particular protocol, if a few participants say, "This protocol is going to cause congestion on the network, and it has no mechanism to back off when congestion occurs; we object to going forward without such a mechanism in place", and the objection is met with silence on the mailing list, there is no consensus.  Even if the working group chair makes a working group "last call" on the document, and 100 people actively reply and say, "This document is ready to go forward", if the open issue hasn't been addressed, there's still no consensus, not even rough consensus. It's the existence of the unaddressed open issue, not the number of people, which is determinative in judging consensus.""
