*\*Disclaimer: I was introduced to Substack by an employee there, who suggested I try the service. Also, I signed up for this in April 2019, so some commentary below might be dated\*

I've [previously described](https://www.leonlinsx.com/why-i-write/ "why write") my reasons for starting a public blog. In addition to this website, I also recently signed up for Substack to publish my [monthly newsletters](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/ "substack"). Before Substack, I'd been emailing my distribution list directly. I moved to Substack for the following benefits:

1. Easier way of managing the email list rather than copying and pasting emails every time, or forgetting to include someone
2. Easier way for uninterested readers to unsubscribe and less awkwardness compared to emailing me directly \[1\]
3. More professional looking newsletter, with easier inclusion of rich media content
4. Analytics of my reader base
5. Potential for greater outreach and perhaps monetisation eventually \[2\]

Here's what I've liked about the service:



**Footnotes**
1. That said, my only unsubscribe so far has come from a friend telling me he wanted to unsubscribe before doing so, so I'm not sure if this is working as intended...
2. This is one of those quotes that will age badly regardless of whether I succeed or fail
