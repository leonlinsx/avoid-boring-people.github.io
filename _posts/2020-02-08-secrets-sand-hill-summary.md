**Are we as gullible now as we used to be?**

[Andrew Odlyzko looked into a famous financial bubble](http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/mania17.pdf "Andrew") and argues that we haven't changed much in terms of how gullible we are. He describes a famous exaggerated anecdote, the source of the exaggeration, and then a likely original source of the tale.  

> One of the most famous \[apocryphal\] anecdotes in finance is of a promoter in the 1720 South Sea Bubble who lured investors into putting money into “an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.” \[Other tales then\] all reflect the high level of credulity displayed by the investors of 1720. However, it is debatable whether their gullibility was greater than that of the most sophisticated investment professionals in recent times

The South Sea Bubble is a time period surrounding [the famous financial bubble in the stock price of the South Sea Company](https://sites.google.com/site/davesmant/monetary-economics/famous-first-bubbles/south-sea-bubble "SSC"), which looked something like the below. 

Andrew traces the origin of the anecdote above to a book by Oldmixon \[1\]. The full anecdote is too lengthy to copy directly so I've placed it in this footnote \[2\], and the summary is essentially:

> A guy was raising money for 'A company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.' He wanted to raise 5k shares at $100 each. To buy the shares you could pay a deposit of $2, with the remainder $98 to be paid when the full details were announced in a month. Within a day he had gotten offers for 1k shares, and he disappeared with the $2k he raised.

Andrew's point is that even in this embellished anecdote, the guy did say he'd provide details in a month, which isn't that different from how investments are made these days. He's got a point. VCs at early stages invest in the founder and not the idea. [SPACs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special-purpose_acquisition_company "SPAC") are vehicles for investors to back another team doing a buyout. To pay to play, with the promise that more information about the idea is coming, is less crazy than it seems

> Based on GDP per capita \[...\] the gains reaped by the projector are comparable to about £2 million \[...\] That is not shabby. But it pales when compared to the sums collected by promoters of the innumerable ICOs (initial coin offerings) in the last few years

I think the general point is true, though I'd quibble that the amount of investors that could invest in ICOs is far larger than that who could have invested in the offering, and that's leading the difference. [Apparently ICOS raised $8bn in 2018](https://www.icodata.io/stats/2018 "ICO")

> The South Sea Bubble was largely inspired by John Law’s Mississippi Scheme in Paris, which reached its peak at the end of 1719. Both the French and the British manias were enabled by the return to relative peace and tranquillity after several prolonged and debilitating wars. Interest rates were dropping, and investors’ “animal spirits” were stirring

This sounds similar to [George Soros' view on reflexivity](https://www.ft.com/content/0ca06172-bfe9-11de-aed2-00144feab49a "Soros") or Howard Marks' on cycles. 

Andrew goes on to describe what he thinks is the likely actual origin story of the famous anecdote. Again, it's too lengthy to copy, so I'll relegate to a footnote \[3\] and summarise here: 

> A paper ran an ad for ppl to buy rights to subscribe to the eventual share offering 'for a new insurance company to be proposed, (whereof publick notice will speedily be given in this paper)'. The rights cost $0.05. After a few days the paper ran another ad saying this was a hoax meant to show how easy it was to deceive people. 

Andrew points out how $0.05 even then was not a huge amount of money, that the total amount raised was low, and also that since the insurance industry was new then it might be less crazy than you think to invest blindly. 

> At the peak of a mania, it is often difficult to tell the difference between satire and reality. As just one example from our era, consider WeWork’s stated mission to “elevate the world’s consciousness.” Several compilations of South Sea Bubble projects list three for building or emptying toilets. Carswell in his book says ads for those ventures were “inserted as pure jokes, which have imposed only on historians”. But they may not have been jokes, as they were treated seriously by most contemporaries

I'd go even further and say that applies more generally to life, and it's hard to tell beforehand. Life is about the narratives we tell ourselves and others. If you have a grand vision and it works, you're praised as a visionary with a [reality distortion field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field "RDF"). If it fails, people mock you. 

> Some of the seemingly preposterous small projects of the South Sea Bubble are not all that farcical when considered in the context of that era. Alchemy was still being taken seriously \[...\] perpetual motion was far more respectable then \[...\] Thus simply looking at the stated aims of various bubbles from 1720 is rather misleading. And the vast majority of the projects were for relatively mundane
businesses

This is also a good point. Knowing what we know now, it's easy to say a 1700 venture to turn lead into gold is worthless. Will people in three centuries say the same thing about our attempts to [make a virtual metaverse](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse "metaverse")? I think the only thing I can be sure of regarding the future is that it'll be crazier than I can imagine.

> while bubbles have a very negative image, they have made positive contributions to society, by spurring development of new technologies and new business models

I've read that the internet bubble allowed for cable networks to be built, laying the foundations for our networks today. Business models that were too early for their time or badly leveraged also keep resurfacing, and sometimes they actually work this time round.

> can we use history to help develop guidelines for detecting dangerous bubbles? The task is certainly not easy, and it seems unlikely that a foolproof method can be found. But one approach \[...\] is to try to develop a gullibility index

> Another might be the expectations of profits that passive corporate investments can achieve, which tend to soar during bubbles

> Yet another might be derived from the nature of the new projects being offered to the public

Andrew concludes by suggesting ways to measure a bubble, which is still something the broader community has not solved today. People buying Tilray on the rise were convinced it wasn't a bubble, and I'm sure that's happening to any number of things today. He details more in his other paper [here](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3142 "paper"); perhaps these could be first steps in measuring bubbles better. 

**Secrets of Sand Hill Road book summary**

I read [Secrets of Sand Hill Road](https://a16z.com/book/secrets-of-sand-hill-road/ "a16z") over the holidays and thought it was a decent intro to VC and how the industry is incentivised. As someone not in the industry and only with public markets and investment banking experience, I still learnt some things that I hadn't known before. If you are in the industry though I feel like there might not be that much new information. 

> the "something more" that Marc and Ben decided to build a16z around was a network of people and institutions that could improve the prospects for founding product CEOs to become world-class CEOs

Recognising that capital could become a commodity and needing to differentiate via other emans.

> For most VCs, the distribution of \[returns\] looks something like this: 

> 50% of the investments are "impaired", which is a very polite way of saying they lose some or all of their investment

> 20-30% of the investments are "singles" or "double". You didn't lose all the money, but instead you made a return of a few times your investment

> 10-20% of the investments are our home runs, where the VC is expecting to return ten to one hundred times her money

Scott's [mentioned this publicly before](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-misconceptions-that-non-industry-people-have-about-venture-capital/answer/Scott-Kupor "Scott") but always helpful to get a reminder of what the [base rate](https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=gIamqy "base rates") are for VC

> How do you evaluate a founding team? Different VCs of course do things differently, but there are a few common areas of investigation:

> Why back this founder against this problem set versus waiting to see who else might come along with a better organic understanding of the problem?

> Can I conceive of a team better equipped to address the market needs that might walk through our doors tomorrow?

> The founders leadership abilities

> Ideas are not proprietary, nor likely to determine success or failure in startup companies. Execution ultimately matters, and execution derives from a team's members being able to work in concert with one another toward a clearly articulated vision.

The last point bears repeating. As [Marc Andreessen pointed out in this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnU5Dikdr2U "Marc talk"), many ideas have historical precedent, but didn't work for some reason or other. Thinking of ideas is easy, getting good ideas is hard, and hacking them to work even harder.

> Sins of omission are worse than sins of commission

Given the power law dynamics discusssed above when talking about VC returns, this is unsurprising. VC stakes in any individual company are small enough that they should aim to diversify.

> \[As a founder\], you should ask about the specific fund from which the VC is proposing to invest in your company \[...\] The later in a fund cycle your investment occurs, the greater the likelihood that the VC may also not have sufficient reserves to set aside for subsequent financing rounds

The later in the fund cycle, the more likely money has been reserved for follow ons of other companaies before you, and the less likely you'll get your shot.

> most GPs contribute 1 percent of the fund's capital, and many times they will contribue 2-5 percent of the capital

Helpful to know industry benchmarks

> If GPs invest in pass-through entities, they can \[create a\] potential tax risk for LPs; investing in C corps raises no such issues. Thus, most GPS will avoid investing in pass-throughs as much as possible.

I always have to look up the differences in tax treatments for various company structures; this is a good reminder of a key reason to structure as a C corp

> \[15 percent\] does tend to be the standard size of an initial employee option pool in a startup

Again, helpful to know industry benchmarks. See [Fred Wilson here](https://avc.com/2011/05/sizing-option-pools-in-connection-with-financings/ "AVC") or [Matt Cooper here](https://medium.com/swlh/a-no-b-s-guide-to-startup-stock-option-grants-526a8bc33c2b "Matt") for more details on option pools and how to value your options

> you should be able to credibly convince yourself that the market opportunity for your business is sufficiently large to be able to genreate a profitable, high-growth, several-hundred-million-dollar-revenue business over a seven-to-ten-year period

Not all businesses benefit from venture capital, given the power law return seeking that we discussed earlier. That doesn't make it a bad business, just one not suited for VC. Some companies run balance sheets that are light on debt, others run heavy on debt. Does that make one inherently better than the other? You might lower your cost of capital taking on more debt, but if it's unsuitable for your business you'll still end up in trouble. In the end it's about taking on the appropriate type of capital *for you*.

> most entrepreneurs at the early stages of their business raise new capital every twelve to twenty-four months

[Carta](https://carta.com/blog/getting-funded-how-long-does-it-actually-take/ "carta") and [Crunchbase](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/the-time-between-vc-rounds-is-shrinking/ "Crunchbase") show fairly similar time periods as well.

> One big mistake we at a16z have seen entrepreneurs make is to raise too small an amount of money at an aggressive valuation, which is precisely the thing you don't want to do. This establishes the high-watermark valuation, but without the financial resources to be able to achieve the business goals required to safely raise your next round well above the current round's valuation.

This is why I am skeptical whenever aggressive early stage valuations are announced in the news. Without more context, it's hard to tell whether that was a good or bad thing for the founders. Often you really only know years down the road or even later. The formative example for recent times would be WeWork.

> if you are pitching a VC and she suggests that your go-to-market plans are all wrong and should instead be done differently from how you have pitched, the wrong reaction is to immediately abandon your plan

> a fact pattern we see very often at the time of a Series A financing is that the entrepreneur is surprised to learn that she has sold much more of the equity than she anticipated through a series of these convertible notes.

I'm preferential to priced rounds, but that's not the current state of the market, as [Fred Wilson](https://avc.com/2017/03/convertible-and-safe-notes/ "AVC") has written about. Priced rounds make cap tables clear to founders, but kicking the can down the road is easier to do, hence the proliferation of ambiguity. A compromise is to make the cap table clear even when you're doing SAFE and other converts, but for some reason people, founders included, seem reluctant to do that. 

> So what do VCs actually do to value early-stage startups?

> what does the company need to look like in five to ten years to be a meaningful return driver, or winner, for its fund? 

> what would have to go right with the business for that to happen? Is the market size they are going after big enough to support a company with $100mm in revenue? What are all the things that could cause the company to fail? How do I assess the probability of each of these nodes on the decision tree toward success or failure?

Given the early stage of the company, financials are usually less relevant. But if you can't tell a story of how you can become a 10-100x return, you probably won't be an attractive candidate for investment

> a greater than 1x liquidation preference can be a way of aligning interest more closely among investors (and employees) who have a much lwoer entry valuation into the company with those who are just entering the company for the first time at a significantly higher valuation

> "nonparticipating" means that the VC doesn't get to double dip. Rather, she gets a choice: take her liquidation preference off the top or convert her preferred shares into common \[...\] "Participating" is the opposite flavour - not only does the VC get her liquidation preference first (her original investment back), but then she also gets to convert her shares into common and participate in any leftover proceeds

Would be interested to know the percentage of deals at all stages that have participating preferreds. 

> there are pros and cons to every deal, and there usually is no definitive right answer. Some of the decision depends on how confident you are in the company's future, how much money you really need now to accomplish your goals, and how much you are willing to gamble on the downside in order to give yourself more upside

Similar to the point I mentioned above about no "platonic ideal" capital structure, just the right one *for you*

> board members do not owe fiduciary duties to the preferred stock. Instead, the courts have long said that preferred rights are purely contractual in nature

I hadn't realised this before

> If you lose a duty of care case, that's certainly no fun, but at least you won't have personal liability for the ultimate damages. Not so with violations of duties of loyalty

Hadn't realised this either

> In the absence of \[doing a down round\], the company may continue to move forward but is likely to face another challenge when seeking to raise its next round of financing \[...\] And nothing can be more damaging to a business than having to reset once again after it is just starting to regain some of its momentum

Notice the trend of how deferring something painful (pricing a round rather than leaving it ambiguous) usually just leads to bigger problems down the road. 

> For a16z, investing in a team of post-investment resources is one way in which the firm hopes to compete among a group of other very successful and competitive venture firms.

You're starting to see this value add spread among the VC community, from [First Round's Talent network](https://firstround.com/talent/ "First Round") to [NFX's content library](https://www.nfx.com/ "NFX"). This comes full circle with the network of people idea that a16z was founded with.

> First, many of the traditional venture capital firms have increased their fund sizes to be able not only to fund startups in the very early stages, but also to be a source of growth capital throughout their life cycles. Second, as companies have elected to stay private longer, more nontraditional sources of growth capital have entered the financing market. Whereas public mutual funds, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, family offices, and other strategic sources of capital had traditionally waited for startups to go public before they would invest growth capital, nearly all these players have now made the decision to invest directly in later-stage startups

Examples include traditionally fundamental long/short tiger cubs such as [Coatue](https://www.businessinsider.com/coatue-management-early-stage-venture-capital-fund-2019-8 "Coatue") or [Tiger Global](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/looks-like-tiger-global-management-just-closed-the-second-biggest-venture-fund-this-year/ "tiger") now having well developed private arms that might be even more successful than their public arms.

2. "The man of genius who essayed this bold and successful inroad upon public credulity, merely stated in his prospectus that the required capital was half a million, in five thousand shares of \[£100\] each, deposit \[£2\] per share. Each subscriber, paying his deposit, would be entitled to \[£100\] per annum per share. How this immense profit was to be obtained, he did not condescend to inform them at that time, but promised, that in a month full particulars should be duly announced, and a call made for the remaining \[£98\] of the subscription. Next morning, at nine o’clock, this great man opened an office in Cornhill. Crowds of people beset his door, and when he shut up at three o’clock, he found that no less than one thousand shares had been subscribed for, and the deposits paid. He was thus, in five hours, the winner of \[£2,000\]. He was philosopher enough to be contented with his venture, and set off the same evening for the Continent. He was never heard of again"
3. "Starting on Friday, 18 December 1719, the Daily Post carried for several days an ad for an “extraordinary scheme for a new insurance company to be proposed, (whereof publick notice will speedily be given in this paper),” with “permits to subscribe” offered for £0.05 each. No names of projectors, nor details of the scheme were cited. The sale of the “permits” took place on Thursday, 24 December. Two days later, this same paper had an ad which offered refunds for the “several hundred” of those permits that had been sold, and explained that the whole thing was a hoax designed to show how easy it was to “impose upon a credulous multitude.” The ad mentioned that the person who had collected the money was unknown to anyone in the crowd, and signed receipts with a name made up from the initials of the 6 people who concocted the scheme"
