## Main

How much can a piece of cardboard be worth?

Way back in another life I used to play a lot of Magic.

Byrne Hobart of The Diff recently wrote a post about [games vs metagames](https://diff.substack.com/p/the-gamerarbitrageur-to-generalist?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Diff"):

> The game is limited, and the metagame is not, but if youâ€™re not great at the core game, knowledge about the meta is basically useless.

If you're unfamiliar with the concept of metagaming, there's a timely controversy now happening in the [Magic: The Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering "MTG") collectible card game community that will illustrate the concept. Let's take a look at cards, [Commander,](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/commander-format "Commander") and [cardboard crack.](https://cardboard-crack.com/ "crack"):

## 1. Intro to Magic

To understand the controversy, we need to get more context for what Magic is. Magic is a trading card game \[1\], where players make a deck of cards and duel against each other. The cards have effects, and the aim is to bring down your opponent's points to zero \[2\]. You take turns drawing cards, playing them, and activating their effects to achieve that goal \[3\].

The cards are released on the primary market by [Wizards](https://magic.wizards.com/en "Wizards"), a subsidiary of publicly traded [Hasbro](https://investor.hasbro.com/investor-relations "Hasbro"). Wizards will regularly design, print, and sell new cards in a "set." Most of the cards are sold via local stores, and in the form of "booster packs." These packs contain random cards from the new set, meaning that you don't know what you're getting before you open them \[4\]. For example, you might buy a pack hoping to get rare card ["Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath"](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/229/uro-titan-of-natures-wrath "Uro") and instead get ["Bronzehead Lion."](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=476461 "Lion")

Because many people do not want to open packs with no guarantee of getting the card they want, there's also a secondary market. Traders buy cards and re-sell them at a markup. Over time, that has even developed into what's essentially a [stock market for the cards](https://www.mtgstocks.com/news "MTG"), with its own club of speculators. As pointed out earlier, some of these cards can be extremely expensive.

Demand for the cards comes from players who want to use them in their decks. There's both an official competitive scene with prize money, and a casual scene where people are playing friends just for fun. The popularity of cards in competitions is one driving factor for usage in casual play. For example, if Uro became popular in competitions and known as a powerful card, more people might want to use it in their decks \[5\]. As with most markets, this causes the price of the card to rise.

Another reason why a card might rise in price is due to supply (what a [shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?name=Shock "shock")). Earlier, I said that Wizards will print cards in a set regularly. Sets are printed for a duration, before it's time for another set to take over. This creates scarcity for a card that might be in one set and then never appear again. For example, a card might be in set Alpha, and then not in set Beta \[6\].

Similar to how the sport of "running" has different "events" such as the 100m, 200m, or 400m, the game of Magic also has [different formats.](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/DCI#Tournament_formats "format") Knowing what the formats are doesn't matter for the understanding of this article; instead it's more important to get the idea that you can play Magic under different formats and rules.

For example, you might play with the most recent 8 sets and a deck of 60 cards in one format, and any possible cards in a deck of 100 in another. Because this affects how well-matched the games are, people will play decks of the same format against each other. It's considered poor form to play a different format's deck without letting your opponent know, and of course official tournaments state the format expected.

The casual scene over time has also developed "fan favourite" formats, the most popular being "Commander." Again, the details don't matter, just think of it as a set of "meta" rules that people choose to follow when making their decks and playing them against each other \[7\]. Just like your dad might have set up house rules in Monopoly saying the oldest player gets to use the bank's money, the player community as a whole decided on some common rules to follow for a format. 

This is where the current controversy begins.

## Footnotes

1. It's actually the *first* trading card game, creating the format. The original, you might say.
2. This is obviously a simplified explanation, and you can read more about the rules [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules "rules"). There are different card types, some being temporary and some being permanent. Not all of them affect your opponent's points (life total) directly. As early as 2005 there were at least [28 ways to win a game of Magic](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/let-me-count-ways-2005-08-15 "MTG")
3. Unless you're playing against an eggs deck, in which case you just watch as your opponent does everything for hours and might as well [walk away while they're playing](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1ai0my/modern_lets_talk_about_eggs/ "eggs")
4. Wizards also sells many pre-made decks, but I've left that out in the main text for simplicity. Also, I could be mistaken, and I don't think buying decks just to get one card has been a thing ever since the Jitte / Rats deck disaster. I haven't followed Magic for ages though.
5. An actual example in this case. Uro has since [been banned](https://gamerant.com/magic-the-gathering-uro-ban/ "ban") for being too powerful. Banned from what exactly? It makes sense to ban a card from competitions, but how can you stop someone playing them in casual formats? That's a question that's related to the controversy, so read on.
6. Alpha and Beta are actual sets in Magic, but it's a fake example this time. I think that any cards in Alpha were also printed in Beta, and [some new cards were actually added in Beta](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Beta "beta")
7. Some of the changes include potentially playing against more than one player, having more cards in your deck, having cards restricted to a certain type, and having a special card - your "Commander". Commander was also known as Elder Dragon Highlander, due to its origins of people playing with certain dragon cards as their commanders.
