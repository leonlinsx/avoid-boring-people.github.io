## Main

How much can a piece of cardboard be worth?

Way back in another life I used to play a lot of Magic.

Byrne Hobart of The Diff recently wrote a post about [games vs metagames](https://diff.substack.com/p/the-gamerarbitrageur-to-generalist?r=1b9e6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy "Diff"):

> The game is limited, and the metagame is not, but if youâ€™re not great at the core game, knowledge about the meta is basically useless.

If you're unfamiliar with the concept of metagaming, there's a timely controversy now happening in the [Magic: The Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering "MTG") collectible card game community that will illustrate the concept. Let's take a look at cards, [Commander,](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/commander-format "Commander") and [cardboard crack.](https://cardboard-crack.com/ "crack"):

## 1. Intro to Magic

To understand the controversy, we need to get more context for what Magic is. Magic is a trading card game \[1\], where players make a deck of cards and duel against each other. The cards all have effects, and the aim is to bring down your opponent's points to zero \[2\]. You take turns drawing cards, playing them, and activating their effects to achieve that goal \[3\].

The cards are released on the primary market by [Wizards](https://magic.wizards.com/en "Wizards"), a subsidiary of [Hasbro](https://investor.hasbro.com/investor-relations "Hasbro"). Wizards will regularly design, print, and sell new cards in a "set." Most of the cards are sold via local stores, and in the form of "booster packs." These packs contain random cards from the new set, meaning that you don't know what you're getting before you open them \[4\]. For example, you might buy a pack hoping to get rare card ["Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath"](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/229/uro-titan-of-natures-wrath "Uro") and instead get ["Bronzehead Lion."](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=476461 "Lion")

Because most cards can only be gotten randomly, there's also a secondary market. Traders buy cards and re-sell them at a markup. Over time, that has even developed into what's essentially a [stock market for the cards](https://www.mtgstocks.com/news "MTG"), with its own club of speculators.

## Footnotes

1. It's actually the *first* trading card game, creating the format. The original, you might say.
2. This is obviously a simplified explanation, and you can read more about the rules [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules "rules"). As early as 2005 there were at least [28 ways to win a game of Magic](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/let-me-count-ways-2005-08-15 "MTG")
3. Unless you're playing against an eggs deck, in which case you just watch as your opponent does everything for hours and might as well [walk away](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1ai0my/modern_lets_talk_about_eggs/ "eggs")
4. Wizards also sells many pre-made decks, but I've left that out in the main text for simplicity. Also, I could be mistaken, and I don't think buying decks just to get one card has been a thing ever since the Jitte / Rats deck disaster. I haven't followed Magic for ages though.
