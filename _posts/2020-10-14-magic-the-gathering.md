## Cards, Commander, Cardboard crack

How much can cardboard cost?

If it's the card [Black Lotus](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Black_Lotus "black") from trading card game [Magic: The Gathering,]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering "MTG") you might be able to buy one for $27,000. 

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/walking/walking 1.png)

And that might even be a steal, considering a copy sold for [$166,000 at auction](https://www.ebay.com/itm/1993-Magic-The-Gathering-MTG-Alpha-Black-Lotus-R-A-BGS-9-5-GEM-MINT-PWCC-/143136537077?_trksid=p2047675.m43663.l10137&nordt=true&rt=nc&orig_cvip=true "ebay") \[1\]. That's $166k for a piece of cardboard the size of a trading card.

Way back in another life I used to play a lot of Magic, the collectible card game that's sometimes unironically referred to as "Cardboard Crack" due to its addictive nature \[2\]. I haven't followed the scene for a decade, but a current controversy caught my curiousity. 

Coupled with Byrne Hobart's recent post about the importance of [games vs metagames](https://diff.substack.com/p/the-gamerarbitrageur-to-generalist? "Diff") \[3\], perhaps I'm fated to write about it this month. Today we'll go over:

1. Introduction to Magic and context for the community complaints
2. What metagaming is and its relevance in Magic
3. The current controversy in "Commander," a popular Magic metagame

Let's take a look at cards, [Commander,](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/commander-format "Commander") and [cardboard crack.](https://cardboard-crack.com/ "crack")

## 1. Intro to Magic

To understand the controversy, we need more context. Magic is a trading card game \[4\], where players make a deck of cards and duel against each other. The cards have effects, and the aim is to bring down your opponent's points to zero \[5\]. You take turns drawing cards, playing them, and activating their effects to achieve that goal \[6\].

The cards are released on the **primary market** by [Wizards](https://magic.wizards.com/en "Wizards"), a subsidiary of publicly traded [Hasbro](https://investor.hasbro.com/investor-relations "Hasbro"). Wizards will regularly design, print, and sell new cards in a "set." Most of the cards are sold via local stores, and in the form of "booster packs." These packs contain random cards from the new set, meaning that you don't know what you're getting before you open them \[7\]. For example, you might buy a pack hoping to get rare card ["Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath"](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/229/uro-titan-of-natures-wrath "Uro") and instead get ["Bronzehide Lion."](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=476461 "Lion")

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/walking/walking 2.png)

Because many people prefer purchasing a card without relying on luck, there's also a **secondary market.** Traders buy cards and re-sell them at a markup. Over time, that has even developed into essentially a [stock market for the cards](https://www.mtgstocks.com/news "MTG"), with its own club of speculators. As pointed out earlier, some of these cards can be extremely expensive.

Notably, Wizards usually doesn't sell single cards on their own, as they want to avoid seeming predatory. They could manipulate the market if they wanted, since all they have to do is print more paper. They don't normally do so, out of worry it could crater the community. For example, imagine the complaints it Wizards directly sold a good card for $500. We'll come back to this. 

**Demand for the cards comes from players who want to use them** in their decks. There's both an official competitive scene with prize money, and a casual scene where people play just for fun. The popularity of cards in competitions is one driving factor for usage in casual play. For example, if Uro became popular in competitions and known as a powerful card, more people might want to use it in their decks \[8\]. As with most markets, this causes the price of the card to rise.

**Another reason why a card might rise in price is due to supply** (what a [shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?name=Shock "shock")). I mentioned that Wizards will print cards in a set regularly. Sets are printed for a duration, before it's time for another set to take over. This creates scarcity for a card that might be in one set and then never appear again. For example, a card might be in set Alpha, and then not in set Beta \[6\].

Similar to how the sport of "running" has different "events" such as the 100m, 200m, or 400m, the game of Magic also has [different formats.](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/DCI#Tournament_formats "format") Knowing what the formats are doesn't matter for the understanding of this article; just understand that you can play Magic under different formats and rules.

For example, you might play with the most recent 8 sets and a deck of 60 cards in one format, and any possible cards in a deck of 100 in another. Because this affects how well-matched the games are, people will play decks of the same format against each other. It's considered poor form to play a different format's deck without letting your opponent know, and of course official tournaments state the format expected.

The casual scene over time has also developed "fan favourite" formats, the most popular being "Commander." Again, the details of Commander don't matter, just think of it as a set of "meta" rules that people choose to follow when making their decks and playing them against each other \[7\]. Just like your dad might have set up house rules in Monopoly saying the oldest player gets to use the bank's money, the player community as a whole decided on some common rules to follow for a format. 

The rules are governed by a community ["rules committee,"](https://mtgcommander.net/index.php/faq/ "RC") which is supposedly independent from Wizards. The committee takes into account player feedback when deciding what cards to allow in Commander, for every new set that is printed. It's usually the newer cards that cause problems, since the older cards have by definition been around longer for people to play with, and any game-breaking interactions should have been discovered. The committee doesn't enforce the rules, since that'd be impossible for casual games, but it serves as a standard guideline that players follow.

This is where the current controversy begins.

## 2. 

Most of the time, the new cards printed are part of a larger Magic multiverse, being Magic IP and originally created for Magic. Magic is mostly fantasy based, leading to cards such as angels and dragons:

More recently \[8\], Wizards has been doing more external partnerships. This usually involves creating a custom card based on other IP. For example, [a My Little Pony series](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/magic-extra-life-2019-10-03 "pony") to raise money for charity:

Or a [Godzilla themed series as alternate art for some cards:](https://articles.starcitygames.com/news/all-19-godzilla-series-monster-cards-revealed/ "zilla")

Now, put yourself in the place of the Commander Rules Committee. When these cards are released, should you allow them in the format?

Besides aesthetic arguments \[9\], the reason you can't easily say yes is that these special cards often have special effects that can unbalance the game. For example, that [Princess Twilight Sparkle](https://shop.tcgplayer.com/magic/ponies-the-galloping/princess-twilight-sparkle "pony") ability would make it [one powerful pony.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveEDH/comments/dczkyh/twilight_sparkles_metarending_magic/ "pony") 

Historically, Wizards avoided ambiguity by doing a few things:

1. Making special "fun" cards silver bordered. By issuing a blanket rule that silver border cards were banned for "normal" play, Wizards could print whatever they wanted without affecting the metagame, of which cards and decks were popular
2. Making the special cards have the same effect as cards that were black bordered and "legal," just with alternate art. Since these cards are printed as part of normal sets and balanced for the game, it shouldn't have a significant effect on the metagame

Now here's the controversy. Wizards just released a [limited edition set of new cards in partnership with TV show The Walking Dead.](https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/product/612738/secret-lair-x-the-walking-dead "dead") These unique cards will only be available for some time before Wizards stops printing them. Importantly, these are black bordered, but not available anywhere else beyond buying this box set.

Should these cards be legal? Wizards' official site says:

> NOTE: These are brand-new cards, not reprints or part of a main set. Therefore, they’re not legal in Standard, but they’re perfect for Commander!

This caused a lot of people to be angry, [calling for the cards to be banned immediately.](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/j1glk8/petition_for_the_commander_rules_committee_to_ban/ "ban") 

img

Hang on, you say, I thought the Rules Committee decided what cards were allowed or not? Indeed, some players held out hope that the Committee would act independently, and declare the cards criminal in Commander. 

[Unfortunately not.](https://mtgcommander.net/index.php/2020/10/02/rc-statement-on-secret-lair-the-walking-dead/ "dead")

You probably have some hint of the conflicting incentives here, and let's take a closer look at the complaints:

1. Card availability
2. Blatantly predatory sales
3. Worry of this being the start of a trend



wait, wrong image

want the money for commander

wizards control vs fan control


expand, profits

## Footnotes

1. I'm simplifying for the sake of the main text, but the condition of the cards is one possible reason for that price disparity. Trading cards get graded on their state and how "used" they are by services such as [Beckett Grading Services](https://www.cardboardconnection.com/collectopedia/card-grading-companies/beckett-grading-services-bgs#:~:text=Fees%20for%20BGS%20and%20BVG,card%20for%20especially%20large%20batches. "beckett"). The $166k Lotus was in near perfect condition and from an early print run.
2. There's even a webcomic named after the phrase [here](https://cardboard-crack.com/ "crack"). Also, just to be clear, I was never very good at Magic. I found Limited draft to be more fun after a few years, since even then Constructed decks were expensive for me.
3. "The game is limited, and the metagame is not, but if you’re not great at the core game, knowledge about the meta is basically useless."
4. It's actually the *first* trading card game, creating the format. The original, you might say.
5. This is obviously a simplified explanation, and you can read more about the rules [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules "rules"). There are different card types, some being temporary and some being permanent. Not all of them affect your opponent's points (life total) directly. As early as 2005 there were at least [28 ways to win a game of Magic](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/let-me-count-ways-2005-08-15 "MTG")
6. Unless you're playing against an eggs deck, in which case you just watch as your opponent does everything for hours and might as well [walk away while they're playing](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1ai0my/modern_lets_talk_about_eggs/ "eggs")
7. Wizards also sells many pre-made decks, but I've left that out in the main text for simplicity. Also, I could be mistaken, and I don't think buying decks just to get one card has been a thing ever since the Jitte / Rats deck disaster, though Nexus of Fate's promo was also problematic. I haven't followed Magic for ages though.
8. An actual example in this case. Uro has since [been banned](https://gamerant.com/magic-the-gathering-uro-ban/ "ban") for being too powerful. Banned from what exactly? It makes sense to ban a card from competitions, but how can you stop someone playing them in casual formats? That's a question that's related to the controversy, so read on.
6. Alpha and Beta are actual sets in Magic, but it's a fake example this time. I think that any cards in Alpha were also printed in Beta, and [some new cards were actually added in Beta](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Beta "beta")
7. Some of the changes include potentially playing against more than one player, having more cards in your deck, having cards restricted to a certain type, and having a special card - your "Commander". Commander was also known as Elder Dragon Highlander, due to its origins of people playing with certain dragon cards as their commanders.
8. This isn't actually the first time Wizards has done external IP, having created sets such as Arabian Nights or Three Kingdoms that are based on exactly what they're named for. I'm leaving that out in the main text for simplicity.
9. Considering that [alters](https://magicalter.com/ "alter") are a thing and [harmless offering](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/freyalise/holistic-wisdom-10-cutest-cards-ever "harm") is a legal card, I don't find the complaint that different IPs will ruin the game as strong as the arguments that I'll detail later. It does matter to a vocal group of players though.
