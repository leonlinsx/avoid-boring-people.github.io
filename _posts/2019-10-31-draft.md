**Takeaways**

3. 

**How to legally own another person**

[Nassim Taleb discusses the nature of work and organisations](https://medium.com/incerto/how-to-legally-own-another-person-4145a1802bf6 "Taleb") \[30\]

> Why were \[freelance monks\] banned \[by the church\]? They were, simply, totally free. They were financially free, and secure, not because of their means but because of their wants. Ironically by being beggars, they had the equivalent of f*** you money 

For those unaware, [fuck you money is the fantasy of having enough money to tell others to fuck off without repurcussions,](https://www.quora.com/What-is-fuck-you-money "fu") acheived by having more money than your needs. You could either move your wealth upwards or expectations downwards, and if you're a beggar your expectations don't have much lower to go. 

> Complete freedom is the last thing you would want if you have an organized religion to run. Total freedom is also a very, very bad thing for you if you have a firm to run

Most firms give some amount of freedom to employees. However, they have a level of expectations for what the employees are supposed to do and deliver; they're not paying them to ignore their work and write a newsletter instead \[31\] 

> So employees exist because they have significant skin in the game –and the risk is shared with them, enough risk for it to be a deterrent and a penalty for acts of undependability, such as failing to show up on time. You are buying dependability. 

Taleb gives an anecdote of how if you had a contracted pilot, she could cancel on you if she got a better offer. The employee pilot is usually more reliable since she's depending on her regular paycheck. 

> The company man –which dominated the twentieth Century –is best defined as someone whose identity is impregnated with the stamp the firm wants to give him. He dresses the part, even uses the language the company expects him to have. His social life is so invested in the company that leaving it inflicts a huge penalty, like banishment from Athens under the Ostrakon. Saturday nights, he goes out with other company men and spouses sharing company jokes. In return, the firm has a pact to keep him on the books as long as feasible, that is, until mandatory retirement after which he would go play golf with a comfortable pension, with as partners former co-workers. The system worked when large corporations survived a long time and were perceived to be longer lasting than nation-states.

> For the person is no longer owned by a company but by something worse: the idea that he needs to be employable. A companies person is someone who feels that he has something huge to lose if he loses his employability –that is, he or she have skin in the game. The employable person is embedded in an industry, with fear of upsetting not just their employer, but other potential employers

> Slave ownership by companies has traditionally taken very curious forms. The best slave is someone you overpay and who know it, terrified of losing his status. Multinational companies created the expat category

> There is a category of employees who aren’t slaves, but these represent a very small proportion of the pool. You can identify them at the following: they don’t give a f*** about their reputation, at least not their corporate reputation.

> Traders who made money, I realized, could get so disruptive that they needed to be kept away from the rest of the employees. That’s the price you pay by associating people to a specific P/L, turning individuals into profit centers, meaning no other criterion mattered. 

Both upside and downside

> People whose survival depends on qualitative “job assessments” by someone of higher rank in an organization cannot be trusted for critical decisions.

> So although an employee is here to prevent an emergency, should there be a change of plan in anything, the employee is stuck. While this paralysis can stem because of the distribution of responsibilities causes a serious dilution, there is another problem of scale
