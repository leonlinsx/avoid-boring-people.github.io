**How to legally own another person**

[Nassim Taleb discusses the nature of work and organisations](https://medium.com/incerto/how-to-legally-own-another-person-4145a1802bf6 "Taleb") \[30\]

> Why were \[freelance monks\] banned \[by the church\]? They were, simply, totally free. They were financially free, and secure, not because of their means but because of their wants. Ironically by being beggars, they had the equivalent of f*** you money 

For those unaware, [fuck you money is the fantasy of having enough money to tell others to fuck off without repurcussions,](https://www.quora.com/What-is-fuck-you-money "fu") acheived by having more money than your needs. You can get this by either moving your wealth upwards or expectations downwards. If you're a beggar your low needs imply a sort of total freedom. 

> Complete freedom is the last thing you would want if you have an organized religion to run. Total freedom is also a very, very bad thing for you if you have a firm to run
. 
Most firms give some amount of freedom to employees. However, they have a level of expectations for what the employees are supposed to do and deliver; they're not paying them to ignore their work and write a newsletter instead \[31\]. Firms want control.

> So employees exist because they have significant skin in the game – and the risk is shared with them, enough risk for it to be a deterrent and a penalty for acts of undependability, such as failing to show up on time. You are buying dependability. 

Taleb gives an anecdote comparing a contractor vs an employee. If you had a contracted pilot for your summer holiday flight, she could cancel on you if she got a better offer. The employee pilot will be more reliable since she's incentivised by her regular paycheck. 

Taleb goes on to talk about "company men" and "companies people", whose identities are intertwined with the places they work for:

> A company man is someone who feels that he has something huge to lose if he doesn’t behave as a company man – that is, he has skin in the game 

> A companies person is someone who feels that he has something huge to lose if he loses his employability

> The employable person is embedded in an industry, with fear of upsetting not just their employer, but other potential employers. An employee is – by design – more valuable inside a firm than outside of it

Many people feel tied to the place they work for and change themselves to fit in with the company culture. The combination of wanting to remain employed at your company and employable generally in the industry incentivises you to dress a certain way, talk a certain jargon, and behave a certain stereotype \[32\]. This works to your advantage when the company or industry is still around, but to your disadvantage when you're laid off or the industry is in decline. 

I've realised that an employee's work generates value mostly for the employer rather than the employee. You're trading future upside for employment and reliable paychecks. This isn't necessarily bad \[33\], but you need to understand that this is the implicit tradeoff you're making. Also keep in mind that you're expendable \[34\]. 

> Slave ownership by companies has traditionally taken very curious forms. The best slave is someone you overpay and who knows it, terrified of losing his status. Multinational companies created the expat category \[...\] Why? Because the further from headquarters an employee is located, the more autonomous his unit, \[hence\] the more you want him to be a slave so he does nothing strange on his own

Taleb explains that in today's increasingly specialised world, a business can shut down when one step in the process is mishandled. This is why things appear to run more smoothly and efficiently than in the past, but errors are costlier \[35\]. Hence, businesses want to buy dependency, thus hiring employees that have a lot to lose should they be unreliable. In his view, the companies essentially legally own their beholden employees. 

Taleb discusses two exceptions to this: 

> One type is the salesperson whose resignation would cause the loss of business, and, what’s worse, he can benefit a competitor by take some of the firm’s client there. 

> The other one was the trader about whom only one thing mattered: the profits and losses, or P/L. Traders who made money, I realized, could get so disruptive that they needed to be kept away from the rest of the employees. That’s the price you pay

If you're an employee judged by a single metric that you have direct control over, you have more independence, and with it more upside and downside. You become closer to an independent contractor within the company rather than an employee. Again, this arrangement works for some and not for others. You can be the most popular person at the firm one year and then fired the next. 

The alternative to employment is to start your own business, like what Lindsay Burton did with [Kayo conference series](https://kayoconferenceseries.com/who-we-are/ "Kayo") (an awesome series btw). Being a fully independent contractor exposes you to the full upside but also downside. Many people like the idea of independence but don't want to deal with the actual frustrating trivialties involved. 

> People whose survival depends on qualitative “job assessments” by someone of higher rank in an organization cannot be trusted for critical decisions.

> So although an employee is here to prevent an emergency, should there be a change of plan in anything, the employee is stuck. While this paralysis can stem because of the distribution of responsibilities causes a serious dilution, there is another problem of scale

I've found that many decisions made within an organisation are to either cover someone's ass or to support an individual's agenda, rather than what may be good for the company as a whole. This makes sense given the incentive structure we've discussed above. Employees are not encouraged to take risk, and the companies that do so are the exception \[36\].

31. No, I do not do this. Really.
32. The realisation that you can do the same amount of work in a T shirt and jeans vs a suit must have been revolutionary. In some ways though, it was! Cultural change takes time.
33. I'm less critical than Taleb here of employment. Everyone has their circumstances on why they're doing what they do. Hey I need to pay rent too.
34. Applies even to founders and majority control shareholders in a business, as seen by Uber and WeWork. The survival of the company (and investor money) is the priority above all.

Many companies *claim* they encourage risk taking but actually don't want the associated volatility.
