Imagine you're an investment analyst \[1\].

Investment analysts research companies and decide which stocks to buy or sell. You've done your work on [Tencent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent "tencent"), a chinese internet company, concluding that the business, management, and macro trends all look good. Gaming and online entertainment [will continue increasing in importance](https://www.statista.com/outlook/203/117/video-games/china "stat"), [the executive team is experienced](https://chinachannel.co/a-deep-dive-into-tencents-restructuring-the-struggle-to-master-b2b/ "tencent"), and population growth provides a tailwind [for at least ten years.](https://ourworldindata.org/future-population-growth "population")

You model all of that up in excel. Write a simple 5 page investment memo. Prepare 50 pages of backpocket complicated charts just in case \[2\]. 

Convinced of your brilliance and diligence, you pitch your boss on Tencent. You time your meeting perfectly, a little after he's been in the office, but before he's busy looking up summer vacation homes.

It seems to go well at first. Your boss is familiar with Tencent, having golfed with the brother-in-law of Tencent's COO. He agrees with all your points on the business, management, and macro. Great.

Coming to the end of your pitch, you're feeling good, and expect your boss to initiate a small position in Tencent. Instead, he sits back in his chair, re-opens his tabs on vacation homes, and tells you you've missed the point completely. Not so great.

What went wrong? 

**Where you screwed up was not considering what market consensus was.** It's a mistake most retail investors make, and sometimes professionals as well. This is particularly important for public market investing.

**Footnotes**

1. Some of you probably are. I'm referring to buyside analysts here, not sellside (who research but don't invest for the firm) or investment banking analysts (contrary to the name, don't invest at all)
2. An investment memo is a write up on the stock you're pitching, commonly used in the investment industry as a way to summarise your idea.
