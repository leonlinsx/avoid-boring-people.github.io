##Don't bet on the most likely winner

Imagine you're an investment analyst \[1\].

Investment analysts research companies and decide which stocks to buy or sell. You've done your work on [Tencent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent "tencent"), a chinese internet company, concluding that the business, management, and macro trends all look good. Gaming and online entertainment [will continue increasing in importance](https://www.statista.com/outlook/203/117/video-games/china "stat"), [the executive team is experienced](https://chinachannel.co/a-deep-dive-into-tencents-restructuring-the-struggle-to-master-b2b/ "tencent"), and population growth provides a tailwind [for at least ten years.](https://ourworldindata.org/future-population-growth "population")

You model all of that up in excel. Write a simple 5 page investment memo. Prepare 50 pages of backpocket complicated charts just in case \[2\]. 

Convinced of your brilliance and diligence, you pitch your boss on Tencent. You time your meeting perfectly, a little after he's been in the office, but before he's busy looking up summer vacation homes.

It seems to go well at first. Your boss is familiar with Tencent, having golfed with the brother-in-law of Tencent's COO. He agrees with all your points on the business, management, and macro. Great.

Coming to the end of your pitch, you're feeling good, and expect your boss to initiate a small position in Tencent. Instead, he sits back in his chair, re-opens his tabs on vacation homes, and tells you you've missed the point completely. Not so great.

What went wrong? 

**Where you screwed up was not considering what market consensus was.** It's a mistake most retail investors make, and sometimes professionals as well. 

**Investing is a game of relatives, not absolutes.** It's how the stock performs *relative to expectations* that determines whether you make above average returns or not. 

All that research you did doesn't matter if it's widely known. By definition, that's already priced in to the market. What you need to show is [what the market is missing, and why that misperception will correct itself.](https://medium.com/graham-and-doddsville/pitch-the-perfect-investment-1a4e8d0c077b "market") If you don't have an edge \[3\], your pitch is pointless. 

It's why companies that post good numbers for their earnings reports can still see their stock price go down. 

It's why illegally knowing company earnings ahead of time [doesn't mean you'll make money 100% of the time.](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2019/comp-pr2019-1.pdf "SEC") \[4\] 

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/SEC edgar hack.png)

And it's why you can get below average returns buying a great company that is priced to perfection, and why you can get above average returns buying a shitty one that was left for dead.

In investing, [you want to bet on the mispriced horse, not the horse most likely to win.](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/you-bet.pdf "bet")

**This applies both at the micro level to individual stock pitches, and at the macro level to investment firm performances.** Absolute skill doesn't matter. It's the fund's skill *relative to competition* that determines whether it can make above average returns. 

It's why [the overall outpeformance (alpha) for hedge funds has stagnated,](http://finance.darden.virginia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Hedge-Fund-Alpha_09.29.2019.pdf "alpha") as more investors know best practices and frameworks.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Hedge fund alpha.png)

It's why information such as credit card, app download, or satellite data is no longer an edge, but table stakes.

[And it's why luck is playing a bigger role, since the dispersion in skill has been reduced.](https://research-doc.credit-suisse.com/docView?language=ENG&format=PDF&source_id=em&document_id=805456950&serialid=LsvBuE4wt3XNGE0V%2B3ec251NK9soTQqcMVQ9q2QuF2I%3D "CS")

In investing, it's all relative.

1. Some of you probably are. I'm referring to buyside analysts here, not sellside (who research but don't invest for the firm) or investment banking analysts (contrary to the name, don't invest at all)
2. An investment memo is a write up on the stock you're pitching, commonly used in the investment industry as a way to summarise your idea.
3. One framework for investment edge is [the information, analysis, or time horizon framework that John Huber uses](http://sabercapitalmgt.com/what-is-your-edge/ "Huber")
