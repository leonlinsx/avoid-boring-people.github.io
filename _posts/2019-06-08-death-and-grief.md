"Aujourd’hui, maman est morte. Ou peut-être hier, je ne sais pas." The opening lines of [The Stranger by Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stranger_(Camus_novel) "Stranger") captivated me when I first read it \[1\] and still captivate me now. They are one of my favourite beginnings to a book. Roughly translated as "Maman died today. Or yesterday, I do not know", \[2\] these simple sentences set off a series of questions in the reader's mind: *Why doesn't he know? Is he overcome with grief? Or was it the opposite and is he incapable of feeling? Is he for real? Would I feel the same way?"

The main character Meursault's indifference to life continues throughout the novel, resulting in an uncomfortable but enthralling read. Paraphrasing Camus, perhaps Meursault's indifference was what condemned him in the game of life. We do not encounter many Meursaults, and hopefully we don't turn into one. Let it remain a work of fiction.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, and in the world of non-fiction, Nautilus published an article about [dying from a broken heart:](http://nautil.us/issue/15/turbulence/can-you-die-from-a-broken-heart "nautilus")

> But can you really die from a broken heart? As it turns out, you can, from “broken-heart syndrome,” also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy. \[...\] But deadly grief is not about stress alone, scientists say. It shines a light on the physiological bonds of love, ceded to us by evolution, so often best understood when broken.



**Footnotes**
1. In english though! My french is so bad that when I try to introduce myself in French stores the other party immediately switches to English without prompting...
2. People still debate about how best to translate this, the first sentence especially. A top ranked search result [from the New Yorker's Ryan Bloom](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/lost-in-translation-what-the-first-line-of-the-stranger-should-be "new yorker") prefers "Today, Maman died". Others use "Maman died today" or "Mother died today". I prefer "Mama died today" and think that it addresses the issue of "Mother" being too distant vs "Maman" being a foreign word, and also reads nicely with "Or yesterday" coming right after "died today". But what do I know, I never took literature beyond middle school so this is all conjecture here.
