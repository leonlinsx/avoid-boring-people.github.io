"Aujourd’hui, maman est morte. Ou peut-être hier, je ne sais pas." The opening lines of The Stranger by Albert Camus captivated me when I first read it \[1\] and still captivates me now. It is one of favourite beginnings in a book. Roughly translated as "Maman died today. Or yesterday, I do not know," \[2\]
