Tyler Cowen recently hosted a [conversation with Sam Altman](https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/tyler-cowen-sam-altman-ai-tech-business-58f530417522 "convo with Sam"), who until recently was the longtime [President at Y Combinator](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/y-combinator-president-sam-altman-is-stepping-down-amid-a-series-of-changes-at-the-accelerator/ "Sam stepping down"), a well known startup accelerator. Below are my thoughts on some of the points made:

> I think it is important to have strong views about the world, and it’s a shame that most people don’t.

I don't fully agree. I do think having stronger views makes it more likely that people listen to you, which is a good thing for your influence, but potentially bad for everyone else if you're basing your views on weak evidence. As a society we seem to have moved towards more extremism in politics, economics, social issues etc \[1\]. As I've written before, [I don't think most of our beliefs stand under scrutiny](https://www.leonlinsx.com/tell-me-why/ "why"). Most people seem to have a strong view on everything and are unwilling to change them. As Byrne Hobart [writes](https://medium.com/@byrnehobart/about-best-of-faq-25df97a74467 "byrne"), opinionated beats objective, at least if you want to get attention. And I think getting attention and influence is a major driving factor for people. 

> Almost every venture capital firm gives advice they never follow themselves. They don’t build differentiated products. They are not network-affected businesses. They don’t try to build a brand and a community. And they don’t try to make something that gets better the bigger it gets and have the scale effects that anyone would tell you they want in a business.

I'm not in venture, but this is an interesting point that I think scales to the wider investment community as well. The qualities that investors look for in a good investment (competitive advantage, good tech, reliable process, returns, price etc) are usually not present in an average investment company. Just look at how everyone's on Bloomberg despite data quality and user experience issues.

> I know in my heart that there will be technological change that will happen at a rate that the companies can’t do or require a level of risk they can’t take. It has been a bad bet to bet against new companies for centuries, and I think that will keep happening.

This seems reasonable. Competitive advantage gets eroded away, as a [graphic like this shows](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/most-valuable-companies-100-years/ "most valuable companies")

> about the only advantage that startups have or the biggest advantage that startups have over large companies is agility, speed, willing to make nonconsensus, concentrated bets, incredible focus. That’s really how you get to beat a big company.

You often hear 'doesn't move the needle' in the investment or business world, where someone complains that an opportunity could be interesting but would be too small to affect the overall return profile of the fund or company. This structural issue leads to opportunity for smaller companies to enter and scale. Perhaps the market may not grow to the extent they were hoping (group discounting? segways? palm pilots?), perhaps it might (social media, ride sharing, live streaming) \[2\] 

> I think a vision that someone feels compelled to make happen in the world is probably the most important of a super successful founder. Then this idea of relentless resourcefulness \[...\] You need to be a great communicator, which I think is a very underappreciated skill, because you have to convince so many people to join you on this quest

Conviction in your alternate view of the world where you're successful, the drive to do whatever it takes to get to that state, and the ability to convey this narrative to other people. Or know what you want, how to get to it, and who you need for it.

> I think one thing that is a really important thing to strive for is being internally driven, being driven to compete with yourself, not with other people. \[...\] But if you’re competing with yourself, and all you’re trying to do is — for the own self-satisfaction and for also the impact you have on the world and the duty you feel to do that

I'm conflicted on this. I think most successful people truly believe that the product, company, idea that they've constructed has helped the world. \[3\] But I don't think they'd be willing to give up the money and status they currently have post-product creation, to go back to a life of obscurity. It's rare that a person who's made that impact on the world refuses to accept the fame or fortune that goes along with it, hence why stories such as [Grigori Perelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman "fields medal rejection") are enthralling. I think that relative comparisons to a peer group matter, since a lot of life is signalling. 

> These personality traits of determination and communication and the ability to articulate a vision for the world and explain how you’re going to get that done — I used to think that that was so hard to assess in 10 minutes, it was maybe impossible to try, and YC interviews used to be like an hour. I now think that most of the time, we could get it right in five minutes.

This is counter-intuitive to me, would love to know more about the 10 minute process and how success/failure of the process itself was evaluated. The obvious first order reaction is to think that this biases founders that are more charismatic. But since charisma matters, as mentioned about in the point about convincing others, should you overindex on this factor? But if everyone knows that charismatic founders are better, than perhaps the ones that aren't are underappreciated relative to the ones that are? 

> People are more convinced by imagery than facts. That’s the other side of nuclear energy.

An important point, not just about energy and the environment, but about human psychology and how to persuade. 

> I have really been able, in the last few years, to take more time to (A) just do nothing with people that I love, and (B) marvel at everything in life and figure out how to look at things for the first time again. That has been a source of great beauty.

Important enough to be a subject of its own post in the future, but most people seem to value relationships when reflecting on their lives. Yet we spend more time at work than with friends or family. I'm still trying to frame this as it regards to regret minimisation

> And all of us, myself included, are much more affected by what other people think of us and our ideas then we like to admit.

This loops back onto my point above where I think that despite people building things for themselves, at some point they do a relative comparision to others and want the approval of peers.

> I don’t do this as much anymore as I used to, but I used to make it a point — I would try to travel 12, 16 weeks a year, and I would try to meet people in other contexts or just observe the world way outside the US.

I've come to think this as well and wish I could travel more. I fear that I have limited perspective when I don't meet new people with a vastly different upbringing.

1. I don't have a large amount of evidence to back this up, but studies like [this](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/ "polarisation") seem to back this up. Then again, you hear stories about how personal insults have [always been the case in politics](https://www.newsweek.com/insults-attacks-american-way-423648 "insults")
2. Structural issues that restrict an investor base's ability to invest in a category are potential opportunities, though that edge could become known and eroded over time. e.g. the tipping point between investment grade and high yield credit, 'sin stocks', illiquid securities. But you have to think about if a catalyst is needed to get your return, and what will catalyse the change in opinion.
3. Put another way, I think the evil psychopath that does evil for it's sake is rare. What's more common is the [bad person who views himself as a good person](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/inside-the-criminal-mind/201105/the-criminal-views-himself-good-person "self view")
