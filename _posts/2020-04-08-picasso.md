The Getty museum challenged the public [to recreate famous works of art recently,](https://blogs.getty.edu/iris/getty-artworks-recreated-with-household-items-by-creative-geniuses-the-world-over/ "Getty") leading to amusing pieces such as this on Reddit \[1\]:

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Picasso woman with bird 1.jpg)

The style of the original image on the left is distinct, and most of you would guess it's something by Picasso, even if you haven't seen it before (I hadn't). [You'd be right](https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/woman-with-bird-1970 "Woman with bird"). 

Of course, with the post came the usual comments of "why is this art", "a child could draw this, it's terrible", "tax evasion for the elites" that accompany most modern artworks. Some of those are valid questions, and perhaps even some of art is a [money laundering](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/art-and-money-laundering "money") or [tax evasion scam](https://newrepublic.com/article/147192/modern-art-serves-rich "tax") \[2\], but let's take a closer look at why Picasso is revered. Bear in mind that I'm not an art expert, and I'm learning as I go, indeed as I write this post.

Most art is best understood with context, so let's start with Picasso's background. [Picasso was born in 1881 to two artistic parents,](https://mymodernmet.com/pablo-picasso-periods/ "Met") at a time where realism in art was still popular. This included paintings such as "Potrait of the Artist's Mother" or "Science and Charity" below
