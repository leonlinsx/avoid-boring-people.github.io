## Main

**Good writing requires good editing** 

In her first profile piece for Fortune, Polina had three out of five pages completely deleted by her editor [Pattie,](https://www.sellerseaston.com/team/pattiesellers "Pattie") \[1\] but it resulted in a better piece. 

> I think iteration, editing, cutting, all that is a very beautiful part of the creative process

> I always try to read it out loud to someone else, because your eyes will skip over mistakes but when you're reading you'll catch them

**Don't write in absolutes**

Another editor gave her the advice "I can tell your thinking is sloppy therefore your writing is also sloppy." If you see the world in black and white, you'll miss the nuance of actual life. The best stories she's read are full of nuance and specific detail. 

That's powerful because you're able to back everything up. For example, when you write something like "nobody liked the CEO," you lose credibility with the reader because they know that's objectively false. 

If you are able to be precise in your thinking and the words you use, you're going to stand out from everyone else. 

**When to stop adding detail**

Sometimes we also add too much detail. Polina likes to send draft pieces to friends that don't know what she's writing about to see if she added too much detail. That said, she prefers gathering more detail upfront rather than less, since you can always delete after. 

**Handling feedback**

Getting feedback can be tough. Polina reminds herself that her editors have her best interests at heart, and wouldn't be hard on her if they didn't think she could handle it. You're often in the weeds and can miss obvious points. It does get better over time.

**Writing misconceptions**

There's a misconception that writing is sitting around waiting to be inspired. Polina says:

> I've never been inspired. Never once in my life have I sat down and been like oh yeah I'm inspired to write, my muse is here. I think it's just typing and it's ugly and it's horrible and I can barely look at it on a page but then going back and massaging it 

In her view, the most important thing is just to start writing. I agree, and the advice here is simple but not easy. People don't like hearing that the way to get better at writing is to write more; they want shortcuts to get good. 

**Finding support networks**

Getting started can be difficult. Polina thinks that you should get two groups for support:

1. Find groups where your desired behaviour is the normal. For example, she's in a business writers group where she can bounce ideas off of \[2\]
2. Family and friends that can act as brakes so you don't go off the deep end

For the former type of groups, she's curated her twitter feed via lists, and is also open-minded at joining groups when invited

**People are only relateable if you see them fail**

In her profiles, Polina emphasizes faults:

> The thing about a compelling profile is one where they succeeded, failed, got redemption, maybe another failure and then another success again. It's like when you lose everything and how you rebuild. People are just looking for lessons on if everything's taken away, how to move on with their lives.

> If you slow somebody down and you can show all the details and your brain can properly process 

**The types of people Polina features**

For her profiles, Polina just looks for people that are interesting to her, and they might not see eye to eye

> I don't want to have criteria for who I feature, because I naturally gravitate towards really complicated characters who I'm fascinated by and I want to include them

> I don't have the same reaction a lot of reporters have, like I can't stand this person and would never want to interview them. I'm like the crazier the better, bring them on. 

**Flexibility of form**

> You shouldn't think about the format, you should think about the story, what you want to do and tell, and the experience you want the reader to have. The format will come out of that e.g. there wasn't a format like [humans of new york](https://www.humansofnewyork.com/ "hony") or [alinea](https://www.alinearestaurant.com/ "alinea") before they created the category

> People will tell you they like reading one thing, but end up reading a totally different thing

**Getting people to open up**

On this, Polina says:

> I've never thought of myself as the most talented writer, I've never thought of myself as the smartest person, but I just know that I have basic social skills where I can make people feel comfortable. And if they feel comfortable they'll tell you things that you want to know. 

> The way I get people to agree for a profile is to do research on them, find something similar, and show you're a human too

**Structure big projects in small pieces**

Polina's always wanted to write a book, but that's a daunting task. What she's doing now is writing pieces of it with profiles on people, and building up to the book over time. The idea is to create a system where you break it down and it's not so massive of a problem.  

**Polina's question for readers**

Here's something Polina would like to know about you: Who is the person you've learnt the most from? Continue the conversation [here]() on twitter!

**Other**

- Polina keeps a list of ideas, which she adds to whenever she comes across something interesting \[10\]
- Sometimes she'll grab a random book off her shelf to see if there's anything that sparks her mind
- Something that Polina's wanted to write about but hasn't yet: how labelling people when young affect them psychologically
- Polina's grand vision for the Profile is to have an even more immersive experience for readers, to actually see a day in the life of someone. That could take the form of a "Profile School" where you go and learn directly from someone, but she doesn't know what it'll look like yet.
- The thing that Polina wish more people knew about her: what people think she's best at are her biggest insecurities, because she had to get good at those skills while growing up

10. I do the same, and have heard similar ideas from others e.g. a "swipe list" where you put down quotes or sentences you really like, to reference for the future.
