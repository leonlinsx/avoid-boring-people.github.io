        overflow: hidden;        
        padding-top: 50%; <!-- Calculated from the aspect ration of the content (in case of 16:9 it is 9/16= 0.5625) -->
        position: relative;
      }
      .iframe-container iframe { 
         border: 0;
         height: 100%; <!-- Finally, width and height are set to 100% so the iframe takes up 100% of the containers space. -->

         top: 0;
         width: 100%;

## Main

**Good writing requires good editing** 

In her first profile piece for Fortune, Polina had three out of five pages completely deleted by her editor [Pattie,](https://www.sellerseaston.com/team/pattiesellers "Pattie") but it resulted in a better piece. 

**Don't write in absolutes**

Another editor gave her the advice "I can tell your thinking is sloppy therefore your writing is also sloppy." If you see the world in black and white, you'll miss the nuance of actual life. The best stories she's read are full of nuance and specific detail. 

That's powerful because you're able to back everything up. For example, when you write something like "nobody liked the CEO," you lose credibility with the reader because they know that's objectively false. 

If you are able to be precise in your thinking and the words you use, you're going to stand out from everyone else. 

**Handling feedback**

Getting feedback can be tough. Polina reminds herself that her editors have her best interests at heart, and wouldn't be hard on her if they didn't think she could handle it. You're often in the weeds and can miss obvious points. It does get better over time.
