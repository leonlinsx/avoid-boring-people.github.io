### Main

An article recently proclaimed that [NYC is dead forever.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nyc-dead-forever-heres-why-james-altucher/ "NYC") Because of the internet, the loss of business, culture, dining, commercial real estate, and colleges in the city has turned from a temporary situation to a permanent outcome. As a result, the article concludes that people are leaving NYC and never coming back.

Similar articles have been written about other large cities, [such as SF.](https://www.sfgate.com/sf-locals/slideshow/I-m-finally-leaving-Stories-of-Bay-Area-203670.php "SF") A couple of people I've talked to have also reflected the same sentiment of wanting to leave the city they're in. I'm not an expert in urban mobility, and let's take a look at some points for and against the death of large cities. 

I'm more optimistic that large cities will survive this. As a way of quantifying that statement - I have 80% confidence that NYC will have a higher population in 5 years than it does today \[1\]. 

Picking a city is like picking a house. It's not a purely financial decision for most. If it was, rents would be much more similar across the country, and it'd be easy to choose the optimal city to live in by comparing the median rent for an apartment of your choice. 

People have their own unique priorities when evaluating cities. The person's priorities can change, and so can the city's ability to provide that priority. Once cities no longer give you what you need, you move (if you can). 

Usually, the pace at which the person's priority changes has been faster than the pace at which a city's ability changes. You move to a city for your first job after graduating college, and then stay there for a while until you need more space for a family. The city stayed the same, you changed.

Recently though, cities have lost nearly everything that attracted people to them. You may have stayed the same and want the same things, but the city changed. If you recall our [pace layer] discussion, in this case the "governance", "infrastructure", and "commerce" layers all moved more quickly than expected.

This volatility has led to a change in mindset from people. What used to be a reluctant consideration of remote work locations has turned into an enthusiastic evaluation of how much further your rent money goes in Austin, Texas. For many people, what used to be unthinkable is now the logical choice.

It's important to distinguish these two types of situation though. In the former, your priorities changed, and you'd likely not move back to a city again after moving out. In the latter, your priorities stayed the same, but all the cool spots are closed for now. When they reopen, you'll be back.

It's like going to a restaurant. If you no longer like that style of food, you're not returning. If your favourite dish is sold out all the time, you'd visit less often but still be interested if it came back on the menu.




As I summarised in the [Josh Wolfe article](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/authentic-contrarians-vs-consensus "Josh"), there'll be continued tension from city folks seeing suburban folks enjoy a more normal life, seemingly without consequences.

### Footnotes

1. I'd compare Aug 2025 vs Aug 2020 if possible, but more likely we'd have to compare Dec 2019 vs Dec 2024 or Dec 2020 vs Dec 2025.
