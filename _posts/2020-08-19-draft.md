### Main

An article recently proclaimed that [NYC is dead forever.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nyc-dead-forever-heres-why-james-altucher/ "NYC") Because of the internet, the loss of business, culture, dining, commercial real estate, and colleges in the city has turned from a temporary situation to a permanent outcome. As a result, the article concludes that people are leaving NYC and never coming back.

Similar articles have been written about other large cities, [such as SF.](https://www.sfgate.com/sf-locals/slideshow/I-m-finally-leaving-Stories-of-Bay-Area-203670.php "SF") A couple of people I've talked to have also reflected the same sentiment of wanting to leave the city they're in. I'm not an expert in urban mobility, and let's take a look at some points for and against the death of large cities. 

I'm more optimistic that large cities will survive this. As a way of quantifying that statement - I have 80% confidence that NYC will have a higher population in 5 years than it does today \[1\]. 

Picking a city is like picking a house. It's not a purely financial decision for most. If it was, rents would be much more similar across the country. 

As I summarised in the [Josh Wolfe article](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/authentic-contrarians-vs-consensus "Josh"), there'll be continued tension from city folks seeing suburban folks enjoy a more normal life, seemingly without consequences.

### Footnotes

1. I'd compare Aug 2025 vs Aug 2020 if possible, but more likely we'd have to compare Dec 2019 vs Dec 2024 or Dec 2020 vs Dec 2025.
