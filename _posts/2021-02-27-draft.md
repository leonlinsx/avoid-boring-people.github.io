## 1.

I played a lot of role-playing games (RPGs) on the PC when I was younger \[1\]. In RPGs, you control a character that grows in strength over time as you complete quests. Some popular ones include [Final Fantasy, World of Warcraft, or Guild Wars](https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Best_selling_RPG_games "rpg") \[2\].

There's a common style of gameplay known as [min-maxing](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing "min"), where players customise their characters to get the maximum performance at minimum cost. You would read all kinds of guides on the "optimal" way to play the game, such as the best [pokemon team](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gameboy/198314-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition/faqs "pokemon") or [the right time to level up your skills in Diablo](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/238750-diablo-ii-includes-expansion-set/faqs/18357 "diablo") \[3\]. I might have spent more time reading guides than actually playing games.
 
How would we apply this to the real world? If you wanted to maximise life, what areas are worth spending time on, and what areas are not?

There's many ways to define the problem:
- Maximise your happiness, in some form of [utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism "utility")
- Maximise impact on others, in some form of [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/ "ea") to maximise help at minimal cost
- Maximise some skills that have high reward vs effort ratio

I want to explore that last option today. 

There's a popular concept in tech of [the 10x engineer](https://www.7pace.com/blog/10x-engineers "10"), either satire or serious business depending on who you talk to. A 10x engineer, so the legends go, is someone who is 10x better than their peers. 

Whether myth or reality, I want to use that framework for our maximisation problem. Let's try to find places that we can indeed be 10x better than the average. Fields where the top performer can be 10x, 100x, or 1000x better on some objective metric are potentially places we can get high return on effort.

For simplicity, we'll first rule out areas that are measured more subjectively. My cousin might think my newsletter is 10x better than others, but somehow I get the feeling she's biased. We'll leave broad fields such as art, performances, food for someone else to analyse \[4\].

We'll start in the realm of physical sport. Usain Bolt is the fastest man in the world, and he's figuratively 10x better than any of us. However, if we actually translate his speed vs that of the average human, he ends up being only ~2x faster. It requires exponentially more hard work and luck to become as good as he is, and he's rewarded richly for it, but the objective difference isn't that large.

The high jump record of 2.45m was set by [Javier Sotomayor](https://www.topendsports.com/sport/athletics/record-high-jump.htm "jump"). I don't have a figure for the average person, but just tried jumping onto my bed, and am going to use 1m as a conservative estimate. Still not 10x.

The deadlift world record is held by [Hafthor Bjornsson](https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/29126803 "hafthor"), popularly known as the Mountain from Game of Thrones, who lifted 1,104 pounds. That sounds like and is a lot, but is only ~3x heavier than the average trained male.

So much for [faster, higher, stronger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_symbols#:~:text=The%20Olympic%20motto%20is%20the,who%20was%20an%20athletics%20enthusiast. "wiki").

## Footnotes

1. Surprisingly, this post was *not* inspired by the [Diablo 2 remaster news](https://diablo2.blizzard.com/en-us/ "d2"); I've been mulling over the concept for a while now.
2. I'm grouping many styles of RPGs together here for convenience, yes I know WoW is an MMORPG and that's such a different type of game you can't even believe I lumped them together now get off my lawn.
3. There were some reasons to do so in D2, [given the skill tree](http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/skills/skillplanning.shtml "d2"); I believe breakpoints might also have been a reason.
4. I do feel I've viewed art, seen performances, and eaten food that is indeed 10x better than average, but we need to limit our scope here and I have an article to write.
