## 1.

I played a lot of role-playing games (RPGs) on the PC when I was younger \[1\]. In RPGs, you control a character that grows in strength over time as you complete quests. Some popular ones include [Final Fantasy, World of Warcraft, or Guild Wars](https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Best_selling_RPG_games "rpg") \[2\].

There's a common style of gameplay known as [min-maxing](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing "min"), where players customise their characters to get the maximum performance at minimum cost. You would read all kinds of guides on the "optimal" way to play the game, such as the best [pokemon team](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gameboy/198314-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition/faqs "pokemon") or [the right time to level up your Diablo skills](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/238750-diablo-ii-includes-expansion-set/faqs/18357 "diablo") \[3\]. I might have spent more time reading guides than actually playing games.
 
How would we apply this to the real world? If you wanted to maximise life, what areas are worth spending time on, and what areas are not?

There's many ways to define the problem:
- Maximise your happiness, in some form of [utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism "utility")
- Maximise impact on others, in some form of [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/ "ea") to maximise help at minimal cost
- Maximise some skills that have high reward vs effort ratio

I want to explore that last option today. 

There's a popular concept in tech of [the 10x engineer](https://www.7pace.com/blog/10x-engineers "10"), either satire or serious business depending on who you talk to. A 10x engineer, so the legends go, is someone who is 10x better than their peers. 

Whether myth or reality, I want to use that framework for our maximisation problem. Let's find places where we can be 10x better than the average, or even 1,000x better. If the top performer is vastly better, the growth cap could be high, leading to high reward vs effort.

For simplicity, we'll first rule out areas that are measured more subjectively. My cousin might think my newsletter is 10x better than others, but somehow I get the feeling she's biased. We'll leave broad fields such as art, performances, food for someone else to analyse \[4\].

We'll start in the realm of physical sport. Usain Bolt is the fastest man in the world, and he's figuratively 10x better than any of us. However, if we actually translate his speed vs that of the average human, he ends up being only ~2x faster. It requires much more hard work and luck to become as good as he is, and he's rewarded richly for it, but the objective difference isn't that large, implying the marginal return to effort is low.

The high jump record of 2.45m was set by [Javier Sotomayor](https://www.topendsports.com/sport/athletics/record-high-jump.htm "jump"). I don't have a figure for the average person, but just tried jumping onto my bed, and am going to use 1m as a conservative estimate. Still not 10x.

The deadlift world record is held by [Hafthor Bjornsson](https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/29126803 "hafthor"), popularly known as the Mountain from Game of Thrones, who lifted 1,104 pounds. That sounds like (and is) a lot, but is only ~3x heavier than the average trained male.

So much for [faster, higher, stronger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_symbols#:~:text=The%20Olympic%20motto%20is%20the,who%20was%20an%20athletics%20enthusiast. "wiki").

Just for fun, I wanted to see if we could find experiences that gave us 10x more happiness, in some biological or chemical way.

It's hard to objectively measure happiness, and I'm going to use [dopamine](https://www.healthline.com/health/dopamine-effects#definition "dope") as my objective metric. Dopamine is a chemical that is associated with pleasure; the more dopamine released the more pleasure felt \[5\]. 

I tried to look for events that cause high dopamine spikes, which I assumed would be drug induced. It was difficult finding the pleasure potential of narcotics on humans online, almost as if people don't want you to do drugs or something. What I did end up finding was a study of rats on [heroin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/syn.890210207 "heroin"), showing a 4x increase in dopamine when doped up \[6\]. That's high, but still not the 10x we want, which was surprising to me \[7\].

We end up having to leave our realms of physics, chemistry, and biology, and instead go into areas that are more abstract \[8\]. 

Can someone be 10x more influential than another person?

I looked at book sales, twitter followers, and instagram followers as a way of quantifying influence. They're imperfect measures, but should give some sense of scale.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone has sold 120mm copies, compared to the average author's sales of ~250.

Obama has 129mm twitter followers, compared to the average twitter user's follower count of ~1,000.

Ronaldo has 264mm instagram followers, compared to the average instagram user's follower count of ~200.

That's definitely more than 10x, even if you discount heavily. I've plotted these new areas against the physical ones, using a log scale to account for the huge differences in magnitude; each line represents 10x increase. See footnotes for sources \[9\]. 

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/a16z gaming market size.png)

We've found some avenues where our efforts can scale, and the diminishing marginal return doesn't diminish as quickly. The ceiling is much higher in such an area, and we get a higher possibility of differentiation compared to the average.

People desiring to become influencers implicitly realise:

1. It's physically possible to be dramatically different from the average. Recalling what we discussed about [relative differences, not absolutes, mattering more](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/relatively-speaking-the-billionaire "relative"), this is one way to visibly signal a high status to others.
2. Although the probability is small, the payoff when you've "made it" is magnitudes larger compared to cost. It's a gamble, but who doesn't love gambling? No wonder we're all addicted.

Out of curiousity, I also plotted the wealth of the richest person in the world against mean household wealth, and it's a similar 100,000x difference. Financial rewards are also something that do not have a ceiling.

## Footnotes

1. Surprisingly, this post was *not* inspired by the [Diablo 2 remaster news](https://diablo2.blizzard.com/en-us/ "d2"); I've been mulling over the concept for a while now.
2. I'm grouping many styles of RPGs together here for convenience, yes I know WoW is an MMORPG and that's such a different type of game you can't even believe I lumped them together now get off my lawn.
3. There were some reasons to do so in D2, [given the skill tree](http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/skills/skillplanning.shtml "d2"); I believe breakpoints might also have been a reason.
4. I do feel I've viewed art, seen performances, and eaten food that is indeed 10x better than average, but we need to limit our scope here and I have an article to write. 
5. This is an oversimplification, as always. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5820768/ "paper") has come to believe that dopamine plays a role in both motivating and demotivating behaviours. "These data, along with other reports, support a considerably more nuanced view of dopamine neuron function, wherein accumbal dopamine release is differentially modulated by positive and negative affective stimuli to promote adaptive behaviors."
6. I also found a study of rats on [coke](https://www.pnas.org/content/102/29/10023 "rat") but can't interpret the results. I believe the numbers I want are in figure 4, if anyone cares to look.
7. I had this figure in my head that drugs caused a 100x increase in pleasure, but can't find the number or a source anywhere. Also, I'm just counting peak here, rather than treating an event 10x longer in duration as being 10x better.
8. We could say that biological growth of generations does follow a 10x or more scale. For example, the descendents of a person could number in the millions. I'm restricting to just single lifetime events here.
9. [Sprints](https://trackspikes.co.uk/average-sprinting-speed/ "sprint"), [high jump](https://www.topendsports.com/sport/athletics/record-high-jump.htm "jump"), deadlift [here](https://www.espn.com/olympics/weightlifting/story/_/id/29126863/hafthor-bjornsson-breaks-world-record-501-kilogram-deadlift "lift") and [here](https://strengthlevel.com/strength-standards/deadlift/lb "lift"), book sales [here](https://nonfictionauthorsassociation.com/how-many-books-can-you-expect-to-sell-the-truth-about-book-sales-and-the-keys-to-generating-income-from-publishing/ "book") and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books#List_of_best-selling_regularly_updated_books "book"), twitter [here](https://kickfactory.com/blog/average-twitter-followers-updated-2016/ "tw") and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-followed_Twitter_accounts "tw") (I rounded the follower count up given the date of article), instagram [here](https://www.hashtagsforlikes.co/blog/instagram-followers-how-many-does-the-average-person-have/ "insta") and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-followed_Instagram_accounts "insta"), wealth [here](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/whats-your-net-worth-and-how-do-you-compare-to-others-2018-09-24 "wealth") and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Americans_by_net_worth "wealth"). I wanted to do tik tok counts as well but couldn't find a good source of data.
