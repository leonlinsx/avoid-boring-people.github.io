*My conviction level:60%*

Why do we believe in what we do? I've written [previously](https://www.leonlinsx.com/where-i-stand/ "where i stand") how people don't reflect enough on what they believe in. Of the strong beliefs that we hold though, what led to us developing and maintaining those beliefs?

There are many "crazy" beliefs that the mainstream public would laugh at now. [Flat earthers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_societies "wiki page") [Moon landing deniers.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories "another wiki page") [Shape-shifting lizard people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptilian_humanoid "more wiki pages") \[1\] Yet most people don't think it's crazy that [70% of Americans](http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/ "religious breakdown") believe in some form of omnipotent being ruling over existence, nor that most people \[2\] think life involves some form of microscopic assembly line [unzipping, squishing together, and re-zipping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqESR7E4b_8&t=1m50s "DNA replication video"). What's interesting to me too is how each faith will have ardent believers willing to defend their beliefs against heretics. Note here I'm using the word 'faith' liberally, across religion, science, philosophical, or other arenas. 

Why then, do we believe in the issues that form so much of our identity? I'm not sure if we have a good reason. For many, the environment in which they were brought up in determines most of their beliefs. There's a correlation between [having religious parents and becoming religious](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/10/26/links-between-childhood-religious-upbringing-and-current-religious-identity/ "religious upbringing"), some evidence that [political views also transmit to children](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231788296_Politics_Across_Generations_Family_Transmission_Reexamined "politics across gens") \[3\], or even [how your career choice might not really be your own.](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html "was it really me?") This is problematic if we'd rather live a life by choice and not by default. [Unexamined life not worth living and all that.](https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/may/12/features11.g24 "unexamined life")

At this point, some people will say that they're the exception, that of course they've examined their life, and that they're confident in their beliefs due to the evidence-based process they've adopted. Some might quote Carl Sagan, saying, [“Why would we commit belief when the evidence is so meager?”](https://www.wired.com/story/sagan-old-interview/ "carl sagan") An evidence-based approach with [bayesian inference](https://brohrer.github.io/how_bayesian_inference_works.html "bayesian inference') frameworks seems like a good approach, where you continue to update your degree of confidence in an issue when faced with new evidence that proves or disproves your theory. I myself try to maintain my beliefs this way.

Yet there's still a problematic issue if we choose the evidence-based approach. How do we evaluate the evidence that we encounter? The scientific crowd likes to extol the virtues of the scientific method, where you test and replicate results to make a point about how the world works. A new discovery should replicate and generalise across a larger dataset in order to be useful. Hence why the discovery of vaccines is important, but the pseudo-science of essential oil disease prevention is rightfully disdained. However, while some experiments are easily replicable, others are not. To some extent, we still have to take much of the science that we read on faith as well. When I read that "a new particle in the mass region around 125 GeV" was discovered in a [huge science experiment involving colliding subatomic particles at high speed,](https://home.cern/science/physics/higgs-boson "cern") and that this particle is fundamental to the universes, I have no option but to trust that it's true. I'm never going to be able to replicate an experiment like that. It's even unlikely for multiple replications of that experiment to occur elsewhere. After all, how many particle accelerators of that size will ever be built within our lifetime? My point here though, is not to discourage evidence-based thinking, but to point out that we still end up having to blindly trust something or someone. \[4\] I don't know how to resolve this yet.

I guess... I want to believe?

1. If you are really out there, know that I'm a proud supporter of the lizard kingdom should the time come for you to take over the world. Long live Queen Diplodocus and all that jazz. 
2. Couldn't find a statistic on "number of people believing in DNA", but did find this [2005 poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/19915/americans-conclusive-about-dna-evidence.aspx "gallup poll") that claimed 80% of people found DNA evidence reliable. Newer articles all seem to refer back to this poll without doing a new poll, which I find disconcerting...
3. As with nearly every social science paper these days, there seems to be concerns over replication for this. The alternative point of view seems to advocate that peer groups, particularly during college, have [higher influence.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/05/parents-political-beliefs/361462/ "parents or peers?") Regardless, both are still part of the environment that you lived through.
4. Cost of beliefs might also make a difference, as described in this tweet [here](https://twitter.com/BigAltheDukie/status/1096465815753256960 "cost of beliefs"). If cost is high and immediate, we have no choice but to believe it's true e.g. running into something. If cost is low and delayed, we are free to believe in whatever we want e.g. the afterlife, how to save for retirement, how that last cookie doesn't count towards your daily intake since it's past midnight
