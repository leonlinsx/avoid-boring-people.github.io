**About quality time**

[About Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/About_Time_(2013_film) "About") is one of my favourite movies ever, and not just because it features Rachel McAdams in yet another time travel movie \[30\]. One of the messages it bludgeons your head with at the end of the movie is to treasure every moment of life. Which, despite coming from a rom-com, is actually an important takeaway I believe in.

If we should treasure every moment, what about the concept of quality time then? [Ryan Holiday recently wrote about how he disagrees with the concept entirely:](https://forge.medium.com/theres-no-such-thing-as-quality-time-58db618c099d "Ryan")

> It’s one of those lines we throw out casually: “I want to spend more ‘quality time'"

> The perfectionist side of our brain \[...\] wants everything to be special, to be “right.” But that’s an ideal that \[we\] can’t always live up to

> The result? An inevitable sense of disappointment

> The reason is that there is no such thing as “quality time.”

Quality time is a concept that has been around a while, with interest in it growing over time.

It's [even one of the love languages.](https://www.5lovelanguages.com/ "love")

Does this mean we've been living in a collective delusion, trying to chase something that doesn't exist? Ryan thinks so, and I mostly agree. Time spent can be high quality, but chasing quality time itself is fruitless. This is due to a combination of expectations and randomness.

We desire quality moments and to make quality memories. It's tempting to think that we can create quality time just by designating it so, such as via a vacation. 

Ryan quotes Jerry Seinfeld on quality time:

> “I’m a believer in the ordinary and the mundane. These guys that talk about ‘quality time’ — I always find that a little sad when they say, ‘We have quality time.’ I don’t want quality time. I want the garbage time. That’s what I like."

He also quotes another advisor on how to find that ordinary time

> “You have to find the moments between moments.”

> Sometimes these awkward, in-between moments allow for conversations that never would have happened otherwise. Even some of my best writing and thinking have come when I was stuck somewhere I didn’t want to be, or doing something I didn’t want to do. 

> When you’re out of excuses for being busy \[...\] you’re forced to just make do with what’s in front of you

30. Yes, I know it received mixed critical reviews. Fight me. Rachel was also in Time Traveller's Wife (meh) and Midnight in Paris (good, and not to be confused with an American in Paris, if not you'll watch half the movie wondering when the musical bit is supposed to come on. Not that it happened to me of course)
