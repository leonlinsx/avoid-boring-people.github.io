## Value investing 

We've talked about [whether investment bankers add value](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/do-investment-bankers-add-value "bank") (probably?), [whether companies add value](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/do-companies-add-value "co") (less than we think), and this week we'll wrap up the value series \[1\] by looking at whether value investing adds value.

The paper [Is (Systematic) Value Investing Dead?](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3554267 "paper") by Ronen Israel, Kristoffer Laursen, Scott Richardson at well-known investment firm AQR discusses whether value investing still works. This follows [an earlier paper this year](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3525096 "paper") from Fama and French, the professors who popularised value investing as an investment factor, which concluded that the return on value investing has declined in recent years \[2\]. 

The AQR paper concludes surprisingly that despite weak performance lately, value investing per their definition isn't dead:

> Both from a theoretical and empirical perspective, expectations of fundamental information have been and continue to be an important driver of security returns. We also address a series of critiques levelled at value investing and find them generally lacking in substance. 



That's why definitions are important. If your "later" in "I'm doing the dishes later" meant two weeks from now vs their "later tonight," you're going to have problems.

## Footnotes

1. I would like to say this was planned from the start of this month, but it was a coincidence.
2. I'm simplifying in the main text here, they actually say that although the return has declined in the latter half of the July 1963-June 2019 period, there's not enough data yet to conclude if value investing as an investment factor works or not. Note I'm using investment factor here as something specific, i.e. a filterable criteria to weight an investment portfolio by.
