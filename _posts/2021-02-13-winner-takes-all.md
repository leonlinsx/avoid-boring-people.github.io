## Main

Josh Breinlinger, a VC at Turtle Ventures, has a short post on his site about [how most marketplaces are not "winner takes all":](https://acrowdedspace.com/post/642666403989684224/winner-take-all-or-not "win")

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/winner_takes_all/win 1.png)

I'm inclined to agree. The natural extension of "winner takes all" leads to a monopoly. I actually can't think of any free market where there's only one player, but might be missing something - feel free to let me know.

"But wait, aren't there tons of monopolies? You just [gave an example last week](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/gambling-is-fine-as-long-as-youve "week")"

As defined by having a single player with all the share - I'm not sure there are?

As defined by having a few players with a lot of the share - Sure, but aren't we significantly changing the definition then?

"That's just semantics, by monopoly everyone knows we actually mean more than one player, with less than all the market, but some larger number"

Alright, let's use that definition, or something like the US FTC's one of a firm ["with significant and durable market power"](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/single-firm-conduct/monopolization-defined "monopoly") \[1\]

Do I have a monopoly on readers of the Avoid Boring People newsletter?

## Footnotes

1. I believe that in practice, it's been hard to pursue monopoly cases with <50% market share, so people have been using that as a benchmark.
