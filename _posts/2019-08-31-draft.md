**Takeaways**

**We're less self-aware than we think**

Most people try to prove they're right - about their business idea, hot stock pick, or the best time travel show of all time \[30\]. I'd encourage you to do the opposite. Instead, if you have a strong opinion on a topic, you should seek to prove yourself wrong \[31\]. Rigidly sticking to your beliefs without examining them is the easy way towards confirmation bias. 

As this [Atlantic article](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/people-don-t-actually-know-themselves-very-well "Atlantic") points out, we don't actually know ourselves very well. There's a discrepancy between how we predict we should behave vs how we actually behave, and it seems like other people might actually be better at describing our actual behaviour. The article cites [a study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-25587-001 "study"):

> Our results show that the operational validities of FFM traits based on observer ratings are higher than those based on self-report ratings.

FFM in the above refers to the [Five Factor Model of personality](https://www.psychologistworld.com/personality/five-factor-model-big-five-personality "FFM"), which is [better regarded than the regular MBTI test.](https://www.leonlinsx.com/Moloch-judger-of-social-credit/ "MBTI") The meta-analysis claims that other people rate our personality more accurately than we do ourselves. I can't access the full paper, but there's a similar [older study](https://home.ubalt.edu/NTYGMITC/641/barrick%20mount%20strauss%20big%20five%20obs%20ratings%20JAP%2094.pdf "old test") that makes a similar claim.

The Atlantic article goes on:

> In the study, people outperformed their friends at predicting how anxious they’d look and sound when giving a speech \[...\] But they did no better than their friends (or than strangers who had met them just eight minutes earlier) at forecasting how assertive they’d be in a group discussion. And when they tried to predict their performance on an IQ test and a creativity test, they were less accurate than their friends.

> And it’s why people fall victim to my new favorite bias: the I’m-not-biased bias, where people tend to believe they have fewer biases than the average American. But you can’t judge whether you’re biased, because when it comes to yourself, you’re the most biased judge of all. 

Humans generally are badly calibrated in their estimations, leading to things such as the [Lake Wobegon effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Wobegon#The_Lake_Wobegon_effect "Lake") where everyone thinks they're above average.
