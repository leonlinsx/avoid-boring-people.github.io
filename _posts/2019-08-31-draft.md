3. We don't know ourselves very well

**Everywhere is Lake Wobegon**

Most people try to prove they're right - about their business idea, hot stock pick, or the best time travel show of all time \[30\]. I'd encourage you to do the opposite. If you have a strong opinion on a topic, you should instead seek to prove yourself wrong \[31\]. Rigidly sticking to your beliefs without examining them is the easy path towards [confirmation bias.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-choice/201504/what-is-confirmation-bias "confirm") 

We like to think we ourselves well; our likes, dislikes, and biases. After all, who better to describe yourself... than yourself? As this [Atlantic article](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/people-don-t-actually-know-themselves-very-well "Atlantic") points out however, we aren't that self-aware. There's a discrepancy between how we predict we should behave vs how we actually behave, and other people might actually be better at describing our actual behaviour. The article cites [a meta-analysis](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-25587-001 "meta"):

> Our results show that the operational validities of FFM traits based on observer ratings are higher than those based on self-report ratings.

FFM in the above refers to the [Five Factor Model of personality](https://www.psychologistworld.com/personality/five-factor-model-big-five-personality "FFM"), which is [usually better regarded than the popular MBTI test.](https://www.leonlinsx.com/Moloch-judger-of-social-credit/ "MBTI") The meta-analysis claims that others rate our personality more accurately than we rate ourselves. I can't access the full paper, but there's a similar [older study](https://home.ubalt.edu/NTYGMITC/641/barrick%20mount%20strauss%20big%20five%20obs%20ratings%20JAP%2094.pdf "old test") making the similar claim that other people's ratings of you have better validity.

The Atlantic article goes on:

> In the study, people outperformed their friends at predicting how anxious they’d look and sound when giving a speech \[...\] But they did no better than their friends (or than strangers who had met them just eight minutes earlier) at forecasting how assertive they’d be in a group discussion. And when they tried to predict their performance on an IQ test and a creativity test, they were less accurate than their friends.

Humans generally are badly calibrated in our estimations, overstating our ability in cases and understating our performance in others, depending on how we might be incentivised. You might recall the [Lake Wobegon effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Wobegon#The_Lake_Wobegon_effect "Lake") that describes how everyone thinks they're above average.  The article suggests a few ways to achieve more self-awareness. 

> One: If you want people to really know you, weekly meetings don’t cut it. You need deep dives with them in high-intensity situations.

> Two: \[...\] I’ve seen a growing number of managers write their own user manuals to help people understand what brings out the best and worst in them. But it’s even better to have the people who know you well write your user manual for you.

> Three: Put yourself in situations where you can’t ignore feedback from multiple sources.

Of these, number three sounds like the simplest approach to start with, as long as both you and your source know how to give and receive feedback \[32\]. Number one might reveal your true inner workings, but I doubt many teams would willingly put themselves in a true extreme situation, compared to the more common wilderness glamping company retreat \[33\]. I like the idea of a user manual in number two and wish I had one of my own, but getting people to spend the time writing it for you is a tough sell. If anyone reading wants to volunteer...

Knowing that we don't know ourselves well is the first step. Unfortunately, just because you're aware of a behavioural bias doesn't mean you can fix it easily, if at all. [Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman "Kahneman") has spent his life studying biases and says he still falls for a majority of them. Besides the three points mentioned above, try [Steelmanning](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning "Steelmanning") rather than Strawmanning topics you disagree with, or seeking out the weak points in your beliefs rather than continuing to emphasise the strong ones. Prove yourself wrong and you might be right more often.

**Footnotes**

30. For the record, it's [Doctor Who,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who "Dr Who"), particularly the brilliant episodes [Blink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(Doctor_Who) "Blink"), [Vincent and the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_and_the_Doctor "Vincent"), and [Heaven Sent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_(Doctor_Who) "Heaven").
31. No joke, I actually considered naming the newsletter Prove Me Wrong.
32. Which is in itself a hard skill, but topic for another day. One good tip I learnt a while back was that even if you think the feedback is false, it's still important, since it represents how your colleagues actually view you, and not what you think they see in you. And how they view you is what matters in the end.
33. Not hating on wilderness glamping, just that it's not extreme enough to trigger the first scenario.
a. There's a natural bias since both David and Jason are online writers, but that doesn't detract from their points.

**Shout outs**

I met [Rob Terrin recently, who thinks a lot about the cyber security space](https://www.tailrisk.com/about "Tail Risk"). Check his company or [twitter](https://twitter.com/robterrin?lang=en "twitter") out if that's an area you're interested in. I'm always open to meeting new people, so let me know if there's anyone that you think I should connect with!
