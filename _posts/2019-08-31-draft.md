3. We don't know ourselves very well

**Everywhere is Lake Wobegon**

Most people try to prove they're right - about their business idea, hot stock pick, or the best time travel show of all time \[30\]. I'd encourage you to do the opposite. Instead, if you have a strong opinion on a topic, you should seek to prove yourself wrong \[31\]. Rigidly sticking to your beliefs without examining them is the easy way towards confirmation bias. 

As this [Atlantic article](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/people-don-t-actually-know-themselves-very-well "Atlantic") points out, we don't actually know ourselves very well. There's a discrepancy between how we predict we should behave vs how we actually behave, and it seems like other people might actually be better at describing our actual behaviour. The article cites [a study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-25587-001 "study"):

> Our results show that the operational validities of FFM traits based on observer ratings are higher than those based on self-report ratings.

FFM in the above refers to the [Five Factor Model of personality](https://www.psychologistworld.com/personality/five-factor-model-big-five-personality "FFM"), which is [better regarded than the regular MBTI test.](https://www.leonlinsx.com/Moloch-judger-of-social-credit/ "MBTI") The meta-analysis claims that other people rate our personality more accurately than we do ourselves. I can't access the full paper, but there's a similar [older study](https://home.ubalt.edu/NTYGMITC/641/barrick%20mount%20strauss%20big%20five%20obs%20ratings%20JAP%2094.pdf "old test") that makes a similar claim.

The Atlantic article goes on:

> In the study, people outperformed their friends at predicting how anxious they’d look and sound when giving a speech \[...\] But they did no better than their friends (or than strangers who had met them just eight minutes earlier) at forecasting how assertive they’d be in a group discussion. And when they tried to predict their performance on an IQ test and a creativity test, they were less accurate than their friends.

> And it’s why people fall victim to my new favorite bias: the I’m-not-biased bias, where people tend to believe they have fewer biases than the average American. But you can’t judge whether you’re biased, because when it comes to yourself, you’re the most biased judge of all. 

Humans generally are badly calibrated in their estimations, overstating our ability in cases and understating our performance in others, depending on how we might be incentivised. You might recall the [Lake Wobegon effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Wobegon#The_Lake_Wobegon_effect "Lake") that describes how everyone thinks they're above average. The article suggests a few ways to achieve more self-awareness. 

> One: If you want people to really know you, weekly meetings don’t cut it. You need deep dives with them in high-intensity situations.

> Two: \[...\] I’ve seen a growing number of managers write their own user manuals to help people understand what brings out the best and worst in them. But it’s even better to have the people who know you well write your user manual for you.

> Three: Put yourself in situations where you can’t ignore feedback from multiple sources.

Of these, number three sounds like the simplest approach to start with, as long as both you and your source know how to give and receive feedback. Number one might reveal your true inner workings, but I doubt many teams would willingly put themselves in a true extreme situation, compared to the more common wilderness glamping company retreat \[32\]. I like the idea of a user manual in number two and wish I had one of my own, but getting people to spend the time writing it for you is a tough sell. If anyone reading wants to volunteer...

Knowing that we don't know ourselves well is the first step. Unfortunately, just because you're aware of a behavioural bias, doesn't mean you can fix it easily. Kahneman has spent his life studying biases and thinks that he still falls for a majority of them in his day to day. Besides the three points the article mentions, try [Steelmanning](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning "Steelmanning") rather than Strawmanning topics that you disagree with, or seeking out the weak points in your beliefs rather than continuing to emphasise the strong ones.
