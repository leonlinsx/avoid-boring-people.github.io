## Main

The activist investment fund Third Point recently published a [letter to Disney,](https://www.valuewalk.com/2020/10/third-point-walt-disney-company/ "disney") suggesting actions the company can take \[1\]. This led to [a rebuttal by another investment firm](https://valueinvestingworld.substack.com/p/chris-bloomstrans-letter-to-the-walt "Semper"), Semper Augustus (h/t Joe Koster). It's less common for investment firms to provide counterarguments against an activist, so let's take a look at both sides \[2\].

To set the stage, let's briefly go over activism and Disney's business, for those unaware.

### Overview on activism

Activist funds like Third Point [usually take a small stake in a company before publicly agitating for company management to take actions which the activists believe will increase company value, usually defined as increasing the stock price.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activist_shareholder "activism") These actions could include paying a dividend, selling off bad business units, or replacing company management. They've risen in popularity the past decade; back when I was in banking I even worked on defending a company against an activist proxy fight (which went horribly, but that's a separate story).

Famous funds and investors include Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman's Pershing Square, and David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital. Since activists want to be listened to, they're usually higher profile than other hedge funds. It helps them when they get press.

Success for an activist investor looks like this: buy stock in a company, tell the company what to do, company does it, stock price goes up, everyone's happy, activist sells stock and takes profit. Most activists are short term holders, though there are exceptions.

Failure could be any part of that step failing. For example, a company might not listen to you. And even if they did, maybe the stock price doesn't move.

Now that we have a rough understanding of activism, let's look at Disney.

### Overview of Disney

I never covered Disney when I was in long/short investing; a colleague did. Nevertheless, let's take a look at [the financials](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2020/01/2019-Annual-Report.pdf "ar") and learn together how the business is run.

Disney reports four major segments, Media Networks, Parks, Studio Entertainment, and Direct-to-Consumer (DTC)

My first thoughts on the above are:

- Media Networks revenue is growing double digits, but operating income growth is only 2%, suggesting deleverage
- Parks on the other hand is growing rev 6%, but getting operating leverage to grow operating income 11%
- Studio grew rev but shrunk operating income, so that's unexpected
- DTC grew >100% on rev, and its operating loss also grew >100% \[3\]. Unusual to see a large company grow so fast, maybe they're doing great?

If we take a look at the operating margins of those segments, they're pretty similar at 20-30%. That was surprising to me, I'd have thought there would be a high margin segment "subsidising" a low margin one. If the margin profiles are indeed similar, management should be indifferent to investing in any of them; perhaps preferring MEdia due to the slightly higher margin \[4\].

## Footnotes

1. I've linked to a third party site for the letter text, and you can also find it [here](https://thirdpointlimited.com/portfolio-updates "third") on Third Point's official site if interested. That link doesn't seem to be a permanent one for the letter, hence the third party link.
2. But not unheard of. Bill Ackman vs Carl Icahn on Herbalife is a famous example.
3. The 100% in the table stands for >100% growth, similar to the >(100)% standing for more than 100% decline
4. This is a simplistic take, since there could be other costs not accounted for in the operating income reported here. The tax treatment for the businesses or interest expense might be different, just to give examples.
