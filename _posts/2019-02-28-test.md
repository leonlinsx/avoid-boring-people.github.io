This post is long and there's no summary provided. ~~Waste your time~~ Read of your own volition.

A poem, then, to start: 

> Moloch whose brief mind is the barrel of gleaming stars! Moloch whose soul is choices of fragrance! Moloch whose framing is glitz and half-cheerios!

> Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!

> Moloch for I don’t believe in god! Moloch who, fought Sins and made Sin out of Sin!

I know what you're thinking: "He's lost it. Leon's gone off the deep end and today's finally the day I unsubscribe to this email list I don't even know how I got on in the first place and can go on pretending I don't know him." \[1\]

What if I told you that of the three lines above, one was from a [famous poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl "howl"), and two were from a computer generated language model? Can you guess which two? [This article](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/19/gpt-2-as-step-toward-general-intelligence/ "gpt 2") has further examples, which range from humourous to eerie. The main and fascinating point the author has to make is: 

> But this should be a wake-up call to people who think AGI is impossible, or totally unrelated to current work, or couldn’t happen by accident. In the context of performing their expected tasks, AIs already pick up other abilities that nobody expected them to learn. \[...\] All that stuff you hear about “AIs can only do one thing” or “AIs only learn what you program them to learn” or “Nobody has any idea what an AGI would even look like” are now obsolete.

I think we might live to see a general AI system, and all the ["Chinese room"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room "chinese room") discussions that would entail, which is both fascinating and terrifying. Some great movies to watch on this theme include ["Her"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(film) "wiki") and ["Ex Machina"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Machina_(film) "wiki")

On the topic of learning, does my chess ability \[2\] carry over into my academic ability? \[3\] This [meta-analysis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0963721417712760 "far transfer") about so-called "far transfer of learning" concludes:

> Although cognitive ability correlates with domain specific skills—for example, smarter people are more likely to be stronger chess players and better musicians—there is little evidence that chess or music instruction makes people smarter. Rather, smarter individuals are more likely to engage and excel in these fields. 

Caveat that I'm not sure if I'm correctly understanding the main stats table in the paper so read it for yourself. There goes my plan of teaching my children chess, though I'm 10 years too early for that. \[4\]

What other false beliefs do we have, and why do we have them? [This interview](http://nautil.us/issue/69/patterns/why-misinformation-is-about-who-you-trust-not-what-you-think "misinformation") discusses misinformation. Select quotes:

> Without getting any immediate feedback, without anything going wrong in your life, you can form these kinds of beliefs.

> When people were first studying anti-arrhythmic drugs, the question was, “Are these going to reduce heart attacks?” Other scientists asked, “Do they reduce arrhythmia?” Big Pharma funded the latter group. It poured money into scientists asking whether these drugs reduced arrhythmia. In fact, they did. But they also increased heart attacks and were responsible for upward of 100,000 premature deaths by heart attack

> If you’re a consumer, you should be looking for scientific articles that aren’t a one-off but rather package a lot of data from various studies. 

Getting quick feedback, aligning incentives, and attempting to reduce your confirmation bias. 

The good news about taking an MBTI test is now you have something to put on your dating profile. The bad news is that the test is flawed to begin with, as described in [this paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spc3.12434?af=R "might need special access")

> Jung likely was trying to figure out the truth behind human psychology, but he was not doing so by creating rigorous theories that could be tested and revised with new knowledge. Indeed, he considered the unscientific nature of his theories to be a strength

In other words he made things up?

> The central premises of the MBTI theory include that people belong to a “true” personality “type”, that “type” causes differences in observed behavior, and that “type” is determined at birth. For the MBTI theory to be correct, each of these three claims needs to be supported. However, each has several validity issues. 

> research on the interaction between intuition and reasoning has shown that they are both ubiquitously operating
and not opposites at all \[...\] to the extent that “thinking” (T) and “feeling” (F) are not actually opposites, it does not make sense to say that people are born with a preference for one or the other, since the “or” is no longer meaningful.

> Sensing and perceiving patterns are such pervasive and nonconscious processes (e.g., Schneider & Chein, 2003) that is most assuredly the case that both bottom‐up processing and top‐down processing are unavoidable. \[...\] These are all basic features of perception and occur automatically, making the idea that people tend to “prefer” one over the other difficult to reconcile.

So 2 of the 4 dimensions are false opposites. It would be similar to describing myself as a dancer with either 'grace' or 'control' when they're both related and I have neither.

> One problem for the MBTI theory's internal consistency is that it asks those that take it to self‐verify the results. \[...\] This is an internal consistency problem because it cannot be the case that “true” personality is both hidden and not. This is, though, easy to justify from a customer service perspective: Assessment takers are simply happier when they have control over the output of the process

> The MBTI theory purports to measure preferences for each of the dichotomies, rather than tendencies or abilities. \[...\] This freedom makes sense from a customer service perspective but not a scientific one.

The conclusion being that MBTI is a business rather than a valid psychological tool and you should now also feel irrationally irate whenever your friends bring it up in conversation. If you are still interested in personality testing though, [Big Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits "wiki") seems to [replicate better](https://mobile.twitter.com/cjsotomatic/status/1091378831057932289) and is scientifically well regarded. Use that to flaunt your sophistication instead.

And what if your personality could be scored on a points system? Reporting on China's social credit initiative compares it to a real life [Black Mirror episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosedive_(Black_Mirror) "Nosedive") where your points determine your lifestyle. \[5\] [This site](https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/social-credit-articles/ "chinalawtranslate") explains how most media coverage is wrong. Key points being that:
  * Sesame credit and social credit are copmletely different things
  * The social credit system generally doesn't even use scores and is more of an information aggregation attempt
  * The much-feared blacklist is not due to a failing score but from undesirable conduct that was recorded elsewhere

1. As mentioned before, I really don't mind if you want to be removed; you'd be doing me a favour since I'm trying to keep the list focused

5. A fantastic TV series if you haven't already watched it btw. Start with the second episode if you're new...
6. Am I considered peranakan? Are most Singaporeans technically peranakan? Hoping someone can answer this
