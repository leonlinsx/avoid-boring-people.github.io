## 1. Invest early in others



## 3. Brett Bivens feature: The Storytelling Thesis

As mentioned, below is the guest post from [Brett Bivens](https://venturedesktop.substack.com/p/the-storytelling-thesis "Brett"). It's about the importance of storytelling, making it a good companion piece to [my earlier article on stories](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/a-story-is-a-lie-and-a-story-is-true "story")

Here's his intro:

> I wrote this a few years ago as I was making the transition from working in startups to investing in them and as I was reflecting on the "best" founders I had interacted with.

> Everything I've learned since has strengthened my belief in the importance of storytelling in company building.

> Hiring, selling, fundraising...storytelling is central.

For companies — large and small — each day is spent telling your story over and over again to all of your key stakeholders. Hiring, selling, raising capital…the storytelling doesn’t stop, it simply changes contexts.

Where collections of people have existed, so too have stories.

A company is a collection of people. A startup company, [to use one definition,](http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup "Blake") is the largest collection of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.

The way that this collection of people — employees, investors, even customers — becomes convinced of that future is through storytelling.

Yuval Noah Harari has [famously pointed out](http://ideas.ted.com/why-humans-run-the-world/ "ideas") that “humans control the world because we are the only animal that can cooperate flexibly in large numbers.” Storytelling is the skill enables this large-scale cooperation.

In the same way, effective storytelling enables companies to separate themselves from competitors and gain control in the marketplace.

*Good storytelling...*

*...bridges gaps by building context and conveying empathy which reinforces commonalities, minimizes cosmetic differences, and helps both sides find common ground. We see ourselves and project our own experiences onto the narratives others build.*

*...makes it possible for large collectives to share systems of beliefs and visions of the future. This applies to companies like it does to religions and political or social movements.*

*...connects the dots. It shifts the view from “what happened” to “why it happened”, “what will happen” to “why will it happen”.*

Progress depends on storytelling and **on the evolution of who is empowered to be a storyteller.** When an overmatched collection of individuals come together to build compelling stories, they not only make their internal bonds stronger, they also create advocates on the outside. From there, the cycle repeats itself. Social movements start small. Religions start small. Businesses start small.

Stories are both the oxygen and the sustenance of these nascent groups. Stories keep these groups alive. Stories help these groups grow. So long as the right story exists, so too does the movement.

### Questions for Brett

**1. What are you practicing deliberately? E.g in the same way a football player would train drills to consciously improve**

There are three things I am practicing deliberately.

The first is writing and I expect this will be a continuous practice for the rest of my life. Good writing comes from clear thinking, so the practice of putting thoughts on paper (and sharing publicly) is an incredible exercise in helping me develop my own perspective on areas that are important to me. In addition, most of the important career opportunities I have had and many of the professional relationships I have built have occured as a result of sharing ideas in public. These opportunities and connections have ramped up significantly over the last 6 months as more have \[sic\] my writing has found an audience.

The next two are closely coupled - I am studying French and also trying to better understand the cultural, political, and economic history of Europe. I moved to France about two years ago to lead the European efforts for TechNexus, the venture firm I work for. It was also a family move as my wife is French. Language and cultural context are so critical to fully integrating into a new community so I'm highly motivated to continue progressing in these areas.

**2. What are the top frameworks you use to understand the world?**

This has been another "practice" area for me over the last few years as I've done a much better job of documenting different principles and frameworks that I encounter and their applications in various parts of my life.

One key framework that I've been very interested in lately is the notion of "Accumulated Accidents". This idea was first identified by Clay Shirky and introduced to me in [Dave Bujnowski's analysis.](https://www.bailliegifford.com/en/usa/professional-investor/insights/ic-article/2020-q2-how-the-pandemic-may-change-things-how-the-pandemic-may-change-things-all-we-0328 "baillie") It asks whether certain societal or economic structures represent an “ideal expression of society” or whether they are simply a series of accidents that can be unwound in the right circumstances. Identifying areas where accumulated accidents are coming together with new technologies or social norms often creates tremendous investment and company building opportunities (areas like health, housing, and education stand out here).

A non-comprehensive list of others frameworks that I think about often are the value of compounding actions (I've experienced this with my writing over the last 6 months), the proximity of one's strengths and weaknesses, George Soros' idea of Reflexivity, and the role of uncertainty vs. risk in decision-making.

**3. What do you wish more people ask you about?**

Living and working in India.

I moved to Bangalore when I was 23 to spearhead international expansion for a startup where I was on the early team. In a short period, we grew the India team that I was leading to nearly 200 people. As you might expect from someone with absolutely no experience in an entirely new culture, I made a ridiculous number of mistakes on what seemed like a daily basis. I learned a ton about prioritization, managing my personal psychology, and cracking cultural codes in order to better understand the motivations and perspectives of the people I was working with.

I also met my wife a couple months after moving to India, so the period was pretty momentus on a personal level as well!
