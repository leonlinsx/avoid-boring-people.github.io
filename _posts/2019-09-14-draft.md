[Benton Moss](https://twitter.com/benton_moss "Benton") of [Circle of Competence](https://www.circleofcompetence.co/ "circle") recently published a [revised framework of how he thinks about developing a circle of competence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qRS-XC4OgZzEsMdkRvZKs1GUZzPaK-49/view "updated"). My thoughts on the document are below:

> When you have skin in the project or posted it publicly, you know \[sic\] are learning about the topic from new angles and have new questions you wouldn't have known to ask when you begin.

[Cunningham's law](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law "cunningham") is a famous saying that "the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer." It takes some courage \[1\] to write on a topic online and be exposed to feedback. However, the pushback and debate that you get will inspire you in new ways. More importantly, it could also help you change your mind on a topic if you're open minded. [I've written before](https://www.leonlinsx.com/about-me/ "about") that I'd rather be proven wrong as early as possible. Posting publicly to get a discussion going is a high leverage way of doing so. 

> You now have more investment into an idea/project and thus it's more important and challenging to keep yourself objective and see the pitfalls with your idea/project.

I have low faith in anyone's self-awareness, including my own. Besides having [decision journals](https://fs.blog/2014/02/decision-journal/ "decision") or well designed checklist processes, another way to keep yourself objective is to continue the external feedback loop regularly, so that the overall project remains objective.

Benton revised his process from a goal-oriented one into a cyclical one instead, having a feedback loop of curiousity -\> knowledge -\> conviction -\> action. Having learning be a continous process makes sense to me! The deeper you go into a topic, the more you realise there's such a depth the the field that you haven't thought about before. 

> The ultimate outcomes of exponential processes are limited by the feedback loops
which fuel their growth and the size of their domain space.
