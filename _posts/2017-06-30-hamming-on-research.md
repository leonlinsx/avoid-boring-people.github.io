[Richard Hamming](https://history.computer.org/pioneers/hamming.html "Hamming") is a mathematician who worked on the Manhattan Project and also contributed foundational work for error-correcting code. Most of his work is too complicated for me to understand, but I chanced upon [this speech](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html "Hamming speech") that I found interesting. Some thoughts below:

> I saw quite a few very capable people. I became very interested in the difference between those who do and those who might have done.

In other words, what characteristics seem to define being good vs being great

> Our society frowns on people who set out to do really good work. You're not supposed to; luck is supposed to descend on you and you do great things by chance. Well, that's a kind of dumb thing to say. I say, why shouldn't you set out to do something significant. You don't have to tell other people, but shouldn't you say to yourself, ``Yes, I would like to do something significant.''

I'm not sure I fully agree here. These days everyone seems to want to be a founder. Have things changed? 

> One of the characteristics of successful scientists is having courage. Once you get your courage up and believe that you can do important problems, then you can. If you think you can't, almost surely you are not going to. Courage is one of the things that Shannon had supremely.

Shannon here referring to Claude Shannon, who'll be the subject of another post. Also another genius. The point about being determined to pursue a problem seems relevant

> When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems. This is what did Shannon in. After information theory, what do you do for an encore? The great scientists often make this error. They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow. They try to get the big thing right off. And that isn't the way things go.

> Now for the matter of drive. You observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive

Again an emphasis on determination and hard work. I personally prefer hard workers over smart people. Do note that hard work isn't a guarantee of success though.

> The steady application of effort with a little bit more work, intelligently applied is what does it. That's the trouble; drive, misapplied, doesn't get you anywhere.
