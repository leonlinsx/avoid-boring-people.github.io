[//]: # (Detailed description)
I like learning.

I like reading.

I like writing.

It's a nice coincidence that a great way to properly learn about what you read is to [teach it.](https://fs.blog/2012/04/learn-anything-faster-with-the-feynman-technique/ "Feynman technique") Writing is how I process ideas and (hopefully) get some feedback on them.

I've had some military, investment banking, and public markets investing experience. I don't just focus on those sectors though, and will read and write about whatever I find interesting. Feel free to send stuff that you're fascinated by!

### My beliefs
Partially inspired by [Devon's blog,](https://devonzuegel.com/page/about-me "Devon's blog") below is a public record of my current beliefs. I'll edit as these change over time, but these should give you a good idea of what I stand for.
#### I should aim to:
  * Be intellectually curious.  There will be subjects too hard or irrelevant, but I want to learn as much as I can. Not knowing something is [different](https://xkcd.com/1053/ "Don't make fun of people for when they don't know things") from being uninterested in knowing 
  * Be upfront about what I don't know. I highly dislike [pretenders](https://fs.blog/2015/01/richard-feynman-knowing-something/ "Feynman on knowing") since I can't trust them. A person that never admits their ignorance is a big red flag, since I have to waste time to figure out what they're making up
  * Be open to changing my mind when enough evidence is presented. [Strong opinions, weakly held.](https://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/ "Saffo on opinions") I'd much rather realise I'm wrong on something early
  * Be concise   
  * Be selective in who I spend time with, since time is precious and I am influenced by my peers. Avoid boring people. Avoid flaky people. Avoid stubborn people
  * Mean what I say. I do lie sometimes, but generally I'm upfront about what I'm thinking. I might avoid awkward questions though
  * Do what I say I'll do. Reliability is important  
#### I also believe:  
  * Understanding [incentives](https://fs.blog/2016/03/distorting-power-of-incentives/ "Munger on incentives") is key to understanding behaviour. Incentive alignment is critical for ideal outcomes
  * Improving [processes and frameworks](https://25iq.com/2016/10/01/a-dozen-things-you-can-learn-by-reading-the-success-equation-by-michael-mauboussin/ "Mauboussin on process") is necessary to make better decisions, particularly for outcomes highly influenced by luck. I like lists and [checklists](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/ "Atul Gawande checklist manifesto") too
  * We should have a [regret minimisation framework,](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2016/10/the-jeff-bezos-regret-minimization-framework/ "Bezos on regret minimisation") and we usually regret things we missed out on rather than things we tried
  * We should be less judgemental
  * The world has too much noise and too little signal, and we're often fooled by randomness
    
### My interests
  * Cocktails, both drinking and making them
  * Chocolate
  * Food in general and reviewing restaurants ranging from budget street food to fine dining. Proud user of [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103299504307574664914/reviews/@40.7441353,-73.98413,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m3!8m2!3m1!1e1 "Maps profile") rather than Yelp. 
  * Internet business models, particularly marketplaces
  * Investing, both public markets and venture
  * Learning how to make better decisions
  * Meeting interesting people and discussing ideas
  * Ballroom dance
  * Bodyweight calisthenics
  * Bouldering
  * Manga, though I read less now than I used to
  * Scuba
  * Suicide prevention and coping with depression
  * Travelling, but more so that I can eat at new places
  * Trying to understand art. Mostly failing
