[//]: # (Resources list)

Below are the blogs, sites, books etc that I've liked. I mostly use a RSS reader to follow interesting sites; currently using [feedly](https://feedly.com/ "feedly link") since they murdered Google Reader. Note that just because I post about something does not mean I endorse the site or the point the author is making.
