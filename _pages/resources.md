[//]: # (Resources list)

Below are the blogs, books, and more that I've liked. Not presented in any particular order. I mostly use a RSS reader to follow interesting sites; currently using [feedly](https://feedly.com/ "feedly link") since they murdered Google Reader. Note that just because I post about something does not mean I endorse the site or the point the author is making.

### Investment sites
1. [Collaborative Fund](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/ "Collabora[tive Fund blog") for VC and investment news
2. [Market folly](https://www.marketfolly.com/ "market folly") for hedge fund news
3. [Value Investing World](https://www.valueinvestingworld.com/ "value investing world") forinvesting frameworks and news
4. [Of Dollars And Data](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/ "Of Dollars And Data") is more personal finance oriented
5. [Matt Levine](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine "Matt Levine") is one of the best financial writers out there
6. [Damodaran](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/ "Musings on Markets") is a great teacher and overall great guy. How many profs will straight out tell you not to buy their overpriced book?

### Economic sites
1. [Marginal revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/ "MR") is famous for good reason, but quantity of posts can be overwhelming
2. [John Cochrane](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/ "Cochrane") applies theory to real life situations
3. [Dan Ariely's](http://danariely.com/resources/the-blog/ "Ariely") is mostly just weekly WSJ Q&A now for behavioural economics

### China sites
1. [Michael Pettis](https://carnegieendowment.org/chinafinancialmarkets/ "Pettis") is fantastic for broader China economic thinking and fixing misconceptions

### Tech sites
1. [a16z](https://a16z.com/ "Andreesen Horowitz") is one of the best known VC firms and puts out frequent content on tech
2. [Benedict Evans](https://www.ben-evans.com/ "Ben Evans"), a partner at a16z, also writes about his personal tech views
3. [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/ "Stratechery") is a mouthful of a site where Ben Thompson writes a lot on tech and media strategy as he sees it
4. [Josh Breinlinger](http://acrowdedspace.com/ "A crowded space") writes mostly about marketplaces, and has a [rake factor article](http://acrowdedspace.com/post/172383900012/marketplace-rake-factors "rake factors") that I really like
5. [NFX](https://www.nfx.com/essays "NFX") has a collection of marketplace and network effects writings that comprehensively discuss the themes in the space
6. [Fred Wilson](https://avc.com/ "AVC") posts on a variety of topics, but mostly venture focused
7. [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/ "techcrunch") is popular for tech news, though I've disliked it after the redesign
8. [Venturebeat](https://venturebeat.com/ "VB") is also popular for tech news
9. [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/ "Hacker News") tends to be more technical, and sometimes goes over my head
10. [Technode](https://technode.com/ "technode") focuses on asia tech news

### Sites about how to think
1. [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/blog/ "FS blog") is probably the most popular one on mental models
2. [Cal Newport](http://calnewport.com/blog/ "Study Hacks") likes to write about productivity
3. [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://medium.com/@nntaleb "Taleb") often writes stuff beyond my understanding, but is worth browsing

### Lifestyle sites
1. [Punch](https://punchdrink.com/ "Punch") is great for cocktail articles and research. I've added to my reper
2. [Eater NY](https://ny.eater.com/ "Eater NY") is helpful for keeping up with the restaurant scene in NY. There's a country wide [site](https://www.eater.com/ "Eater") too
3. [Grubstreet](http://www.grubstreet.com/ "grubstreet") is slightly annoying for me since they hide their articles in RSS till after the jump but might be a complement to Eater

### Webcomics
1. [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/ "xkcd") is wide ranging in what it covers and often thought-provoking
  * If you're like me and lost sometimes, [explain xkcd](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page "explain xkcd") is there for you
2. [The Order of the Stick](http://www.giantitp.com/Comics.html "Oots") has been going on for a long time now and is great for DnD fans
3. [Lackadaisy Cats](https://www.lackadaisy.com/ "lackadaisy") has fantastic art but infrequent updates
4. [Wonderella](http://nonadventures.com/ "wonderella") is ridiculous and great
5. [Ctrl Alt Del](https://cad-comic.com/ "CAD") was probably one of the first webcomics I started with, and is gaming focused

1. [Chandoo's](https://chandoo.org/wp/ "Chandoo") excel blog is helpful whenever I have obscure excel problems
