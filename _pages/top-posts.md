If you're figuring out whether I'm worth the time to read, here's a couple of top posts to start with:


1. [Moloch the judger of social credit](https://www.leonlinsx.com/Moloch-judger-of-social-credit/)

2. [Procrastinate another way another day](https://www.leonlinsx.com/procrastinate-another-way/)

3. [Temporal illusions](https://www.leonlinsx.com/temporal-illusions/)

4. [Additional marketplace rake factors](https://www.leonlinsx.com/additional-marketplace-rake-factors/)

5. [What I'd want to learn in investment banking](https://www.leonlinsx.com/banking-knowledge-base/)

I also have a monthly newsletter [here](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/ "sign up link") that summarises interesting things I've come across for the month.
